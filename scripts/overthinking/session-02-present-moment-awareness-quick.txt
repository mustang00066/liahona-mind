Duration: ~28 minutes
Voice: Male, British accent, calm and soothing

[BEGIN SCRIPT]

Welcome back, Austin. Today we focus on the present moment. Overthinking lives in the past and future. The present is its antidote.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Take a deep breath in... hold... and release, arriving in this moment.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Another breath, deeper... letting go of what was and what might be... hold... and release.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One more breath... eyes closing, being here now.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let the golden light of presence anchor you in now. Head to toe. Thoughts of past and future fading. Fully present.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Descend now. Ten to one. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Completely present.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

There is only this moment. The past is memory. The future is imagination. Only now is real.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Overthinking replays the past: What did they mean? Why did that happen? These questions cannot change anything.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Overthinking projects the future: What if? How will it turn out? These questions cannot be answered. The future does not exist yet.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The Savior taught, Take no thought for the morrow. Live today. Let tomorrow wait.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let us practice presence. Bring your attention to your body. What do you feel? The surface beneath you. The temperature. The weight.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Now your breath. The air entering. The pause. The air leaving. Just this breath.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Now sounds. What do you hear? Just hear. Do not analyze.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This is presence. You were not in the past or future. You were simply here.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When overthinking starts, ask: Am I in the present? If not, return. What do I feel? What do I hear? These questions bring you back.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The present moment is always peaceful because it is always manageable. One moment at a time. One breath at a time.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One... beginning to return.
Two... feeling present and grounded.
Three... becoming alert.
Four... refreshed and centered.
Five... eyes open, fully alert. You are present now, Austin. This is where peace lives.
