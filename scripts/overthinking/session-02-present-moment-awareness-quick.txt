=== PRE-TALK / SETTLING (1-2 minutes) ===

Welcome back, Austin. In our first session, you discovered the stillness beneath the mental noise and created an anchor for quieting the busy mind. Today, we focus on the present moment... overthinking's most powerful antidote.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Overthinking almost never happens in the present. It lives in the past, replaying and analyzing. It lives in the future, worrying and anticipating. But right here, right now, there is peace.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

The Savior taught, "Take no thought for the morrow." This is wisdom about presence. Today we learn to live it.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== INDUCTION - Rapid Relaxation with Breathing (5-6 minutes) ===

Take a deep diaphragmatic breath now. Belly breathing... when you breathe in, your belly expands. When you breathe out, it sinks down.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Breathe in through your nose... let your belly rise... hold gently... and release through your mouth. This breathing brings you into now.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Another breath... deeper... and as you exhale, allow your eyes to close naturally. You are arriving.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let your neck become loose like rubber bands. Your head floating like a helium balloon. Jaws sagging. Shoulders dropping completely.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Arms and hands becoming heavy... limp, loose, and heavy. Like lead weights. So heavy it would take too much effort to lift them.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Legs and feet the same. So limp, so loose, so heavy with relaxation. Completely letting go.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The better you feel, the deeper you go. The deeper you go, the more present you become.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your eyelids now... so relaxed they've become wonderfully heavy. As though gently stuck together. This heaviness is presence. This heaviness is now.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

It feels so good to just relax. It feels so good to just breathe. It feels so good to be right here.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== DEEPENING (3-4 minutes) ===

Imagine yourself at the top of a staircase... ten steps leading down to a garden that exists entirely in the present moment. No past. No future. Only now.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Ten. Stepping down. Leaving the past behind.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Nine. Deeper. The future fading from concern.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Eight. Only this moment beginning to matter.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Seven. Present moment becoming vivid.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Six. Halfway there. So present.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Five. The garden coming into view.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Four. Ready to be fully here.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Three. Almost there.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Two. One more step.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

One. You step into the present moment.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

You are now in the eternal now, Austin. There is no past here. No future. Only this. Only here. Only peace.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

=== THERAPEUTIC CONTENT (8-10 minutes) ===

Receive only what serves you. Your subconscious mind will accept what is true for you and let the rest go.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

--- Understanding Time and Presence ---

Your mind can replay the past and imagine the future. This is useful for learning and planning. But when misused, it becomes overthinking... replaying pain, imagining troubles that may never come.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Here is the crucial insight: only now is real. The past is memory. The future is imagination. Only this moment actually exists. And in this moment, you are safe.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- The River Metaphor ---

Imagine sitting beside a river. The river is time, flowing from past to future. The overthinker stands in the river, trying to see where the water came from and where it's going.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

But you can sit on the bank. From there, you simply watch the water pass. You don't chase it. You don't hold it. The present moment is the bank... solid ground where you actually exist.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Practicing Presence ---

Let's practice. Bring attention to your body. What do you feel? The surface beneath you. The weight of your limbs. The temperature of the air.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

You were not thinking about the past just now. Not worrying about the future. Just here. This is presence.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Now, bring attention to your breath. The air entering. The pause. The air leaving. Just this breath.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

Body... breath... sounds. Three doorways back to now. Use them whenever you notice you've left.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Direct Suggestions ---

Listen now as your subconscious receives these suggestions.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

From this day forward, you notice when your mind has left the present. A gentle awareness arises: "I am in the past" or "I am in the future."

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You notice when your mind has left the present. This awareness becomes automatic.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When you notice you've left, you return easily. What do I feel? What do I hear? What is actually happening? And you're back.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You are developing a preference for presence. The present moment feels like home. Time-traveling feels uncomfortable.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You trust life to unfold. You meet each moment as it arrives. You don't need to pre-live your life through worry.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Reinforcing the Anchor ---

Press your thumb and middle finger together now.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Your anchor carries stillness from Session 1. Now add presence. Feel the peace of this moment flowing into your fingers. Stillness and presence together.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Thumb and middle finger together means: quiet mind, present moment. The past fades. The future disappears. Only now.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Release. The anchor is reinforced.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

--- Future Pacing ---

See yourself tomorrow... mind drifting to the past... you recognize it... you return to now. A week from now... presence strengthening. A month from now... living primarily in the present, actually experiencing your life.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== POST-HYPNOTIC SUGGESTIONS (1 minute) ===

These changes are becoming permanent. Each time you listen, presence deepens.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Remember: body, breath, sounds. Three doorways back to now.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Remember your anchor. Thumb and middle finger. Instant presence.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== EMERGENCE (2-3 minutes) ===

It's time to return to full awareness, bringing presence with you.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

I'll count from one to five. With each number, you become more alert while staying anchored in now.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

One. Beginning to return. Presence coming with you.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Two. More aware of your body. Fingers and toes moving slightly.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Three. Energy returning. Feeling refreshed.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Four. Almost fully alert. Feeling wonderful.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Five. Eyes open, fully awake, completely alert, and deeply present.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Welcome back, Austin. Notice this moment. The colors. The sounds. The sensations. You are here. This is where life happens.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

The present moment is your refuge. The past is memory. The future is imagination. Only now is real. And right now, you are at peace.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Sufficient unto the day. This day. This moment. This breath.
