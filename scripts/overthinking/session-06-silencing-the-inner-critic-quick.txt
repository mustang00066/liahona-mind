OVERTHINKING - SESSION 6: Silencing the Inner Critic (QUICK VERSION)
Duration: ~28 minutes
Voice: Male, British accent, calm and soothing

[BEGIN SCRIPT]

Welcome back, Austin. Today we address the inner critic. That harsh voice that judges and attacks. You will learn to silence it and speak kindly to yourself.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Take a deep breath in... hold... and release, beginning to quiet the critic.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Another breath, deeper... creating space for kindness... hold... and release.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One more breath... eyes closing, inner voice softening.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let the golden light of compassion transform harsh words. Head to toe. The critic's volume lowering. Kindness rising.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Descend now. Ten to one. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Complete inner peace.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The inner critic developed to protect you. But now it fuels overthinking. Every action analyzed for flaws. Every thought judged. Exhausting.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You do not have to believe the critic. Those harsh words are thoughts, not facts. A habit, not reality.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The scripture teaches, Love thy neighbour as thyself. Many are cruel to themselves in ways they would never treat others. This must change.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Imagine the voice coming from a scared part of you. A frightened child trying to protect you through criticism. See it with compassion.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Say: Thank you for trying to protect me. But I do not need this anymore. You can rest.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Introduce an inner supporter. Kind, encouraging, wise. What would it say? You are doing your best. I am proud of you. I love you.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Feel how different this voice feels. Warmth instead of tension. Relief instead of pain.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When the critic speaks, notice it. Say: That is the critic, not the truth. Then call your supporter.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Replace criticism with kindness. Instead of you are stupid, say I am learning. Instead of you fail, say I am growing.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One... beginning to return.
Two... feeling supported and kind.
Three... becoming alert.
Four... refreshed and gentle.
Five... eyes open, fully alert. Speak kindly to yourself, Austin. You deserve it.
