Duration: ~28 minutes
Voice: Male, British accent, calm and soothing

[BEGIN SCRIPT]

Welcome back, Austin. Today we address decision paralysis. The overthinking mind analyzes endlessly, never ready to choose. You will learn to decide with confidence.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Take a deep breath in... hold... and release, feeling capable and clear.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Another breath, deeper... trusting your ability to choose... hold... and release.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One more breath... eyes closing, mind focusing.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let the golden light bring clarity. Head to toe. Fog of indecision clearing. Sharp, peaceful focus.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Descend now. Ten to one. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Complete clarity.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Decision paralysis comes from believing there is one perfect choice. But this is false. Most decisions have multiple good options.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Waiting for certainty is refusing to decide. In most decisions, any reasonable choice is better than no choice.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The scripture says, Ask of God in faith, nothing wavering. Faith means deciding before you have all answers.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The decision process: First, clarify what you are deciding. Second, gather reasonable, not perfect, information.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Third, consider your options. Usually two to four. Fourth, notice your gut feeling. Trust it as data.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Fifth, decide. Pick an option. Say: I choose this. Sixth, commit. Stop analyzing. Move forward.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

If it does not work, adjust. Decisions are rarely permanent. This reduces the pressure.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Think of a decision you have been avoiding. What are your options? What does your gut say?

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Now, decide. In your mind: I choose this. Feel the relief. You just decided. It was not that hard.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One... beginning to return.
Two... feeling clear and capable.
Three... becoming alert.
Four... refreshed and decisive.
Five... eyes open, fully alert. You can decide now, Austin. Trust yourself.
