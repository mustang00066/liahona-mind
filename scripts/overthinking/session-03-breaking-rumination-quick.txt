Duration: ~28 minutes
Voice: Male, British accent, calm and soothing

[BEGIN SCRIPT]

Welcome back, Austin. Today we tackle rumination. That endless loop of the same thoughts. You will learn to break this cycle.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Take a deep breath in... hold... and release, beginning to break free.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Another breath, deeper... loosening repetitive thoughts... hold... and release.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One more breath... eyes closing, loops dissolving.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let the golden light interrupt patterns. Head to toe. Spinning thoughts slowing. Relief spreading. Complete peace.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Descend now. Ten to one. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Complete freedom.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Rumination is like a broken record. The same groove playing over and over. But you can stop it.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Rumination often focuses on what you cannot change. Past mistakes. Others' behavior. The mind chews endlessly, solving nothing.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The first step is awareness. Notice when you ruminate. Say: I am ruminating right now. This creates distance and choice.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

To interrupt rumination, try physical movement. Change your body, change your mind. Stand. Walk. Move.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Or try strong sensation. Hold ice. Smell something strong. Sensation interrupts thought patterns.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Or ask: Is this thought useful? Will continuing change anything? If no, give yourself permission to stop.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Imagine placing the looping thought in a box. Close the lid. The thought is contained. It cannot loop in the box.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The scripture says, Casting all your care upon him, for he careth for you. Give ruminating thoughts to God. Lord, take this thought.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

From now on, catch rumination early. Notice the loop. Choose an interruption. Movement. Sensation. The box. Surrender.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Each successful interruption weakens the habit. Your brain learns that loops can be broken.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One... beginning to return.
Two... feeling free and empowered.
Three... becoming alert.
Four... refreshed and capable.
Five... eyes open, fully alert. The loops no longer control you, Austin.
