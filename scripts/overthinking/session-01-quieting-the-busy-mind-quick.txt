Duration: ~28 minutes
Voice: Male, British accent, calm and soothing

[BEGIN SCRIPT]

Welcome, Austin. You have come seeking relief from a mind that never stops. Today, you begin learning to quiet that busy mind.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Take a deep breath in... hold... and release, already beginning to slow down.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Another breath, deeper... thoughts beginning to ease... hold... and release.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One more breath... eyes closing, mind resting.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let golden light quiet your thinking mind. Head to toe. The endless chatter fading. Forehead smoothing. Body relaxing. Peace spreading.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Descend now. Ten to one. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Profound peace.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Here, the constant noise of your mind finally rests. Listen to the silence.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Overthinking is a habit. Your mind believes endless thinking keeps you safe. But overthinking does not solve problems. It creates suffering.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Thinking has diminishing returns. The first pass is useful. But the hundredth repetition? That is rumination, not thinking.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The scripture teaches, Be still, and know that I am God. Stillness is not emptiness. It is presence.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let us practice stillness now. Simply be. Notice your breath. Notice your body. Nothing more.

[PAUSE 8 SECONDS]

That was stillness. Peaceful. Restful. Available always.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let us create a stillness anchor. Press your thumb and middle finger together.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Feel the quiet peace flowing into this gesture. Stillness. Presence. Relief from endless thought.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Release. The anchor is set. Whenever you press thumb to middle finger, your mind quiets. Stillness returns.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You have discovered stillness. You have felt what a quiet mind feels like. This is your foundation.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One... beginning to return.
Two... feeling rested and quiet.
Three... becoming alert.
Four... refreshed.
Five... eyes open, fully alert. Your mind can be quiet now, Austin.
