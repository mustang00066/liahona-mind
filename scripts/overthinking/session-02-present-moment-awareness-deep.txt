[BEGIN SCRIPT]

=== PRE-TALK / SETTLING (2-3 minutes) ===

Welcome back, Austin. In our first session, you discovered the stillness that exists beneath the mental noise. You learned that you are not your thoughts, and you created an anchor for quieting the busy mind. Today, we go deeper into one of the most powerful antidotes to overthinking: present moment awareness.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Overthinking has a peculiar characteristic: it almost never happens in the present moment. Think about it. When you're caught in the grip of overthinking, where does your mind actually go? It goes to the past... replaying conversations, analyzing what happened, wishing you had done things differently. Or it goes to the future... worrying about what might happen, planning for scenarios that may never occur, anticipating problems that don't yet exist.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The present moment, this moment right here, is almost always peaceful. The present moment is almost always manageable. It's only when the mind time-travels that overwhelm sets in.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Today you will learn to anchor yourself in the eternal now. You will discover that the present moment is your refuge... a place where overthinking simply cannot follow.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The Savior taught, "Take no thought for the morrow, for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof." This is wisdom about living in the present. Today's concerns are enough for today. Let tomorrow wait.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Now... let us arrive fully in this moment.

=== INDUCTION - Eye Fatigue and Diaphragmatic Breathing (10-12 minutes) ===

Before we close your eyes, find a spot above your natural line of sight. Perhaps on the ceiling... or high on the wall ahead. Focus your eyes on that spot now.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Notice how this upward gaze begins to tire your eye muscles. Those small muscles working... and becoming fatigued. This tiredness is welcome. It helps your mind let go.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

As you hold this gaze, begin your diaphragmatic breathing. Belly breathing... when you breathe in, your belly expands like a balloon. When you breathe out, your belly button sinks toward your spine.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Breathe in deeply through your nose... let your belly rise... hold for a moment... and release slowly through your mouth.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

This breathing stimulates your vagus nerve. That nerve sends a signal directly to your brain: "We are safe. We are here. We can relax." Your nervous system responds by settling into peace.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Take another deep belly breath. Your eyes still focused upward... heavier... more tired with each moment. Breathe in... belly expanding... hold... and release. Notice how each exhale brings you more fully into this moment.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

One more breath. And as you exhale this time, allow your eyes to close. Let them fall shut with relief. You have arrived.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Good. Now imagine your neck becoming like a bundle of loose rubber bands. All tension dissolving. Your head floating gently... like a helium balloon... effortlessly supported.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Allow your jaws to sag. Your mouth opening slightly. Your tongue resting loosely. Complete facial relaxation. The muscles of your forehead smoothing out.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let your shoulders sag completely. All that weight you carry... let it fall away now. Shoulders dropping... dropping... as low as they can go.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

Your arms and hands becoming limp, loose, and heavy. So limp, so loose, so heavy with relaxation... like heavy lead weights. So heavy it would feel impossible to lift them.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

Your legs and feet now. Let them go limp, loose, and heavy. Like heavy lead weights. Complete surrender to relaxation.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

The better you feel, the deeper you go. The deeper you go, the better you feel. And the more present you become.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

It feels so good to just relax. It feels so good to just breathe. It feels so good to be right here, right now.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Your eyelids now... so relaxed they've become wonderfully heavy. As though gently stuck together. The harder you might try to open them, the more they want to stay closed. This heaviness is presence. This heaviness is now.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

From head to toe, you are deeply, wonderfully relaxed. Your body is at peace. Your mind is quieting. You are arriving fully in this moment.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== DEEPENING (8-10 minutes) ===

Now, imagine yourself at the top of a beautiful staircase. This staircase leads down to a special place... a garden that exists entirely in the present moment. Here, there is no past to replay. There is no future to worry about. There is only now.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The staircase has twenty steps, each one bringing you deeper into the present. With each step, you leave the past further behind. With each step, the future fades from concern. Only now remains.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step twenty. You place your foot on the first step. Already the mental time-traveling is slowing.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Nineteen. Another step down. The past growing distant. Memories softening.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Eighteen. Deeper now. The future losing its grip. What-ifs fading.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Seventeen. Going deeper. Only this moment beginning to matter.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Sixteen. The present moment becoming more vivid. More real.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Fifteen. Past and future like distant shores you're sailing away from.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Fourteen. Deeper still. More present. More here.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Thirteen. So calm. So peaceful. So now.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Twelve. The garden coming into view below. A place of eternal present.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Eleven. Your subconscious opening to presence.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Ten. Halfway there. Halfway into now.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Nine. Every suggestion I offer anchors you more firmly in this moment.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Eight. Deeper. More present. More alive.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Seven. Almost there. The garden waiting.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Six. Profound presence. Profound peace.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Five. So deep now. So fully here.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Four. The past cannot follow.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Three. The future cannot reach.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Two. One more step.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

One. You step into the garden of the present moment.

[PAUSE 8 SECONDS]

You are now in the eternal now, Austin. Look around this garden. Notice the vivid colors... the textures... the light. Everything is sharper here because you are fully present to experience it. This is how life is meant to be lived... one moment at a time.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

Find a comfortable place to rest in this garden. Perhaps beneath a beautiful tree... or beside a gentle stream... or in a patch of warm sunlight. Settle in. There is nowhere else to be. There is nothing else to do. There is only now.

[PAUSE 8 SECONDS]

=== THERAPEUTIC CONTENT (15-18 minutes) ===

You remain in complete control. Your deeper mind will accept only the suggestions that align with your values and serve your growth. Everything else simply fades away.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

--- Understanding Time and Overthinking ---

Austin, let us explore why the present moment is such a powerful antidote to overthinking.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your mind has a remarkable ability to simulate experiences. It can replay the past as though you were living it again. It can imagine the future as though it were already happening. This is useful for learning from experience and planning ahead.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

But this same ability, when misused, becomes overthinking. The mind replays painful moments again and again, generating the same difficult emotions each time. The mind imagines troubling futures again and again, generating anxiety about things that haven't happened.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Here is the crucial insight: only the present moment is real. The past exists only as memory... a story your mind tells about what happened. That story may be accurate or distorted, but either way, it is not happening now. The future exists only as imagination... a story your mind tells about what might happen. That story may come true or not, but either way, it is not happening now.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Right now, in this actual moment, you are safe. You are breathing. You are listening to my voice. Everything else... the regrets, the worries, the what-ifs... are mental constructions, not present reality.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

When you learn to distinguish between what is actually happening and what the mind is simulating, you gain enormous freedom. The actual present is almost always manageable. It's the simulated past and future that overwhelm.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

--- The River Metaphor ---

Let me offer you a way to understand your relationship with time.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Imagine yourself sitting beside a river. The river is time... it flows endlessly from the past toward the future. You might think you need to watch the entire river... to keep track of every moment that has flowed by, to anticipate every moment yet to come.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The overthinker tries to do exactly this. They stand in the river, facing upstream, trying to see where the water came from. They turn downstream, trying to see where the water is going. They are so busy watching the river that they never simply experience being by the river.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

But you can step out of the river. You can sit on the bank. And from the bank, you can simply watch the water flow past. You don't need to follow it upstream or downstream. You can just be here, where you are, watching this water pass.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Thoughts about the past and future are like the water. They flow through your mind naturally. You don't need to chase them. You don't need to hold onto them. You can simply sit on the bank of your awareness and watch them pass.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The present moment is the bank. It is solid ground. It is where you actually exist. The river of time flows past, but you... you are here.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

--- Practicing Presence ---

Let us practice presence now. I will guide you through a simple exercise that you can use anytime you notice yourself lost in past or future.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

First, bring your attention to your body. Without opening your eyes, notice what you feel. Feel the surface beneath you... is it soft or firm? Feel the weight of your limbs... how heavy do they feel? Feel the temperature of the air on your skin... is it warm or cool?

[PAUSE 8 SECONDS]

Good. You were not thinking about the past just now. You were not worrying about the future. You were simply here, feeling your body. This is presence.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Now, bring your attention to your breath. Notice the air entering your nostrils... is it cool or warm? Notice the pause at the top of the breath. Notice the air leaving... is it slower or faster than the inhale? Just observe. Don't try to control it.

[PAUSE 8 SECONDS]

Again, you were present. Your attention was on this breath, not on past breaths or future breaths. Just this one. This is how presence works.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Now, bring your attention to sounds. What do you hear? Perhaps my voice. Perhaps the silence between my words. Perhaps sounds in your environment. Don't judge them or analyze them. Just hear them.

[PAUSE 8 SECONDS]

This is presence, Austin. Body... breath... sounds. Three simple doorways back to the present moment. Whenever you catch yourself overthinking, you can use any of these to return to now.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

--- The Gift of Now ---

Let me share with you why the present moment is called a gift.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

In the present moment, you have everything you need. Right now, you are breathing. You are alive. You are here. Whatever problems exist in your life, they exist as thoughts about past or future. In this actual moment, you are okay.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

In the present moment, life is actually experienced. The taste of food... the warmth of connection... the beauty of nature... the satisfaction of accomplishment. None of these can be experienced in the past or future. They can only be experienced now. Every moment spent overthinking is a moment of actual life missed.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

In the present moment, you have power. The past cannot be changed... you are powerless there. The future has not arrived... you cannot act there. But in this moment, right now, you can choose. You can act. You can create. All power exists in the present.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

In the present moment, peace is found. The mind that is here, now, is at rest. The mind that is time-traveling is never at rest. It is always chasing or fleeing. Presence is peace.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

--- Direct Suggestions ---

And now, as you rest deeply in the present, your subconscious mind is ready to receive positive suggestions. Listen carefully to these words.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

From this day forward, you notice when your mind has left the present. A gentle awareness arises: "I am in the past" or "I am in the future." This recognition comes easily and naturally.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

You notice when your mind has left the present. This awareness becomes automatic.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When you notice you've left the present, you return easily. You ask: What do I feel? What do I hear? What is actually happening right now? And your attention returns to this moment.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

You are developing a strong preference for presence. The present moment feels like home. Time-traveling feels uncomfortable. You naturally gravitate toward now.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

You find that the present moment is enough. You don't need to rehash the past. You don't need to control the future. This moment, as it is, is sufficient.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

You trust life to unfold. You respond to each moment as it arrives. You do not need to pre-live your life through worry. The future will bring what it brings, and you will meet it then.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

--- Reinforcing the Anchor ---

Press your thumb and middle finger together now.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

In Session 1, you established this anchor for stillness. Now, let us add to it the quality of presence. Feel all the peace of this present moment flowing into your fingers. The stillness of a quiet mind combined with the grounding of being here, now.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Hold the pressure. Your anchor now carries both stillness and presence. Thumb and middle finger together means: quiet mind, present moment. The past fades. The future disappears. There is only now.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

Release. The anchor is reinforced. Use it whenever you catch yourself lost in time. It will bring you back.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Future Pacing ---

See yourself tomorrow. You notice your mind drifting to the past... replaying something. Immediately, you recognize it. "I am in the past." You bring attention to your body, your breath. You return to now. And you continue your day from the present.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

A week from now. The habit of presence is strengthening. You catch yourself earlier when overthinking begins. You spend more time actually in your life rather than thinking about your life. Others may notice you seem more centered, more grounded.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

A month from now. Present moment awareness has become your natural state. The past and future still exist in your mind, but they've lost their grip. You visit them when useful, and you return to now with ease. Life feels more vivid because you are actually here to experience it.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

A year from now. You look back on this session as a turning point. The person you've become lives primarily in the present. Overthinking is rare because you've learned the art of being here. Peace is your default because presence is your home.

[PAUSE 8 SECONDS]

=== POST-HYPNOTIC SUGGESTIONS (2-3 minutes) ===

As you rest in this deep presence, your subconscious is integrating everything. These changes are becoming permanent.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

In the days ahead, you will notice moments of unexpected presence. You may be doing something ordinary when suddenly you realize: "I am completely here." Accept these moments as signs that the work is taking hold.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Each time you listen to this session, your capacity for presence expands. The present moment becomes more accessible. The pull of past and future weakens.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Remember: body, breath, sounds. Three doorways back to now. Use them freely.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Remember your anchor. Thumb and middle finger. Instant stillness and presence.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== EMERGENCE (3-5 minutes) ===

And now, Austin, it's time to return to full waking consciousness. But know this: the present moment comes with you. It is not left behind in this garden. It is available always, wherever you are.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

In a moment, I will count from one to ten. With each number, you'll become more alert, more awake, more refreshed... while remaining anchored in now.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One. Beginning to return. Presence coming with you.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Two. Becoming more aware of your body. Your fingers and toes beginning to move.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Three. The room around you becoming more present. Here and now.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Four. More alert. Energy returning to your body.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Five. Halfway back. Feeling wonderfully refreshed and grounded.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Six. Your eyes may flutter. Your body preparing to return.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Seven. More and more alert. Feeling peaceful and present.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Eight. Almost there. Taking a deep, refreshing breath.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Nine. Ready to open your eyes and be fully here.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Ten. Eyes open, fully awake, completely alert, and deeply present.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Welcome back, Austin. Take a moment to notice this moment. The colors you see. The sounds you hear. The sensations in your body. You are here. This is where life happens.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Remember: the present moment is your refuge. The past is just memory. The future is just imagination. Only now is real. And right now, in this moment, you are at peace.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Take no thought for the morrow. Sufficient unto the day. This day. This moment. This breath.
