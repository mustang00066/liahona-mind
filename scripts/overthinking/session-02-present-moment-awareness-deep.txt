Duration: ~38 minutes
Voice: Male, British accent, calm and soothing

[BEGIN SCRIPT]

Welcome back, Austin. Today we focus on the present moment. Overthinking lives in the past and future. The present moment is its antidote.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Find your comfortable position. Take a deep breath in... hold gently... and release, arriving in this moment.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Another breath, deeper... letting go of what was and what might be... hold... and release, being here now.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

One more breath... breathing in the present... hold... and as you exhale, let your eyes close and be fully here.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let the golden light of presence begin at your head. This light anchors you in now. Scalp softening. Thoughts of past and future fading.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The warmth flows through your face, your neck, your shoulders. Each area you touch becomes present. Not remembering. Not anticipating. Just being.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Down through your arms, your hands. Through your chest, your stomach. Through your back, your hips, your legs, your feet. Fully embodied. Fully present.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Now the staircase. Twenty steps down to the most present peace.

Twenty, nineteen, eighteen, seventeen, sixteen... deeper into now.
Fifteen, fourteen, thirteen, twelve, eleven... releasing past and future.
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six... fully arriving.
Five, four, three, two, one... completely present.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

You are in the eternal now, Austin. There is only this moment. There has only ever been this moment. The past is memory. The future is imagination. Only now is real.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Overthinking takes you out of now. It replays the past: What did I say? What did they mean? Why did that happen? These questions cannot change anything.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Overthinking projects the future: What if this happens? What will I do? How will it turn out? These questions cannot be answered. The future does not exist yet.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The only moment where life actually happens is now. The only moment where you can act, feel, experience, is now. Overthinking steals now from you.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The Savior taught, Take no thought for the morrow, for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof. Live today. Let tomorrow wait.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let us practice presence now. Bring your attention to your body. What do you feel? The surface beneath you. The temperature of the air. The weight of your limbs.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Now, bring your attention to your breath. The air entering. The pause. The air leaving. Just this breath. Just this moment.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Now, bring your attention to sounds. What do you hear? Perhaps my voice. Perhaps silence. Perhaps something else. Just hear. Do not analyze.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

This is presence. You were not thinking about the past. You were not worrying about the future. You were simply here. This is the gift of the present moment.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

From now on, when you catch yourself overthinking, you will ask: Am I in the present? Usually, the answer is no. You are in the past or future.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When you notice this, simply return to now. What do I feel? What do I hear? What do I see? These questions bring you back.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your stillness anchor helps here too. Press thumb to middle finger, and you return to the present moment. The past fades. The future disappears. There is only now.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The present moment is always peaceful because it is always manageable. You can handle this moment. It is only when we accumulate imaginary moments that we feel overwhelmed.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One moment at a time. One breath at a time. This is how life is actually lived. The mind that lives in the present is a peaceful mind.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Rest in the present moment now. There is nowhere to go. Nothing to figure out. Just this. Just here. Just now.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

It is time to return, carrying presence with you. As I count from one to ten, you will become alert, anchored in now.

One... beginning to return.
Two... feeling present and grounded.
Three... becoming more aware.
Four... refreshed and centered.
Five... halfway back.
Six... alertness increasing.
Seven... feeling wonderful.
Eight... almost there.
Nine... nearly fully awake.
Ten... eyes open, fully alert. You are present now, Austin. Stay here. This is where peace lives.
