OVERTHINKING - SESSION 5: Releasing Perfectionism (QUICK VERSION)
Duration: ~28 minutes
Voice: Male, British accent, calm and soothing

[BEGIN SCRIPT]

Welcome back, Austin. Today we release perfectionism. That voice saying nothing is ever good enough. You will learn to embrace good enough.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Take a deep breath in... hold... and release, letting go of impossible standards.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Another breath, deeper... accepting your humanity... hold... and release.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One more breath... eyes closing, judgment softening.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let the golden light of acceptance dissolve harsh standards. Head to toe. The critic quieting. Kindness emerging.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Descend now. Ten to one. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Complete peace with yourself.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Perfectionism disguises itself as high standards. But it is really fear. Fear of not being enough.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Perfectionism drives overthinking because nothing meets its standards. You analyze endlessly, paralyzed by impossible demands.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The truth: perfection is impossible. What is possible is excellence—doing your best with available resources. That is sustainable.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The scripture teaches that men are that they might have joy. Not perfection. Joy.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You extend grace to others. When a friend fails, you forgive them. You deserve the same grace. You are human too.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When perfectionism speaks, recognize it. Ask: Is this helping me improve, or just making me suffer?

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Replace perfectionism with: I did my best. This is good enough. Mistakes are how I learn.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Good enough is powerful. Not mediocre—sufficient. Ready to move forward. It allows you to finish things.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The perfectionist finishes nothing. The person embracing good enough finishes many things and improves over time.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One... beginning to return.
Two... feeling accepted and at peace.
Three... becoming alert.
Four... refreshed and kind to yourself.
Five... eyes open, fully alert. You are good enough, Austin. Believe it.
