=== PRE-TALK / SETTLING (1-2 minutes) ===

Welcome back, Austin. Today we address one of perfectionism's core lies: that "good enough" is not enough.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

You will learn that done is better than perfect, that excellence does not require perfection, and that "good enough" is often more than enough.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let us embrace what is achievable and valuable.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== INDUCTION - Rapid Relaxation with Breathing (5-6 minutes) ===

Take a deep breath now. Diaphragmatic breathing—belly expanding as you breathe in, sinking as you breathe out.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Breathe in through your nose... belly rising gently... hold for a moment... and release. Good enough is good enough.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Another breath... deeper... and as you exhale, allow your eyes to close naturally.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let your neck become loose like rubber bands. Head floating. Jaws sagging. Shoulders dropping.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Arms becoming limp, loose, and heavy. All the way down to your hands.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Legs and feet the same. The better you feel, the deeper you go. Done is better than perfect.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Your eyelids becoming wonderfully heavy. As though gently stuck together. Ready for wisdom.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== DEEPENING (3-4 minutes) ===

Imagine yourself at the top of a staircase... ten steps leading down to a place of practical wisdom.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Ten. Stepping down. Wisdom growing.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Nine. Deeper. Perfectionism softening.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Eight. Ready for reality.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Seven. Deeper still.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Six. Halfway there.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Five. So wise. So practical.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Four. Almost there.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Three. "Good enough" acceptable.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Two. One more step.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

One. You enter a place of wisdom. Here done is better than perfect. Everything you hear will be absorbed completely.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== THERAPEUTIC CONTENT (8-10 minutes) ===

Receive only what serves you. Your subconscious mind will accept what is true for you and let the rest go.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

--- Perfection Is Impossible ---

Perfection is impossible. Nothing you create will be flawless. Demanding the impossible guarantees frustration.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- What "Good Enough" Means ---

"Good enough" means meeting requirements without unnecessary polish. An email that communicates is good enough. A presentation that conveys your points is good enough.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Most situations call for "good enough," not perfect. Wisdom is knowing the difference.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Done Is Better Than Perfect ---

A completed project, even imperfect, has value. An uncompleted project, endlessly polished, has none.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Imperfect action beats perfect inaction. A good enough solution today beats a perfect solution that never arrives.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- The 80/20 Principle ---

80 percent of results come from 20 percent of effort. The last 20 percent often requires 80 percent more effort.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Wisdom recognizes when you have reached "good enough" and moves on.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Practicing "Good Enough" ---

Before starting: "What is good enough for this?"
While working: "Am I past good enough?"
When finished: "This is good enough. Done is better than perfect."

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Anchor Reinforcement ---

Bring thumb and pointer finger together, reinforcing your anchor.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

This anchor carries the wisdom of "good enough." Permission to finish and move on.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Say internally: "Good enough is good enough. Done is better than perfect."

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Release the gesture.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== POST-HYPNOTIC SUGGESTIONS (1 minute) ===

You will recognize when "good enough" has been achieved. You will stop polishing and move on.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

You will complete more. You will finish things. Your productivity increases.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

"Good enough" is becoming your friend.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== EMERGENCE (2-3 minutes) ===

It is time to return to full awareness, bringing wisdom with you.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

I will count from one to five. With each number, you become more alert while acceptance deepens.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

One. Beginning to return. Wisdom installed.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Two. Energy returning. Practical now.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Three. Permission to finish.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Four. Almost fully alert. At peace.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Five. Eyes open, fully awake, completely alert, and embracing "good enough."

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Welcome back, Austin. Practice declaring "good enough" this week. Done is better than perfect.
