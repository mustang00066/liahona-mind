Duration: ~38 minutes
Voice: Male, British accent, warm and encouraging

[BEGIN SCRIPT]

Welcome back, Austin. Today we address the barriers to presence. The distractions that steal you from your family. You will learn to put them away and truly be there.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Put away all devices. Take a deep breath in... hold gently... and release, already more present.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Another breath, deeper... letting go of all that pulls attention... hold... and release, focus sharpening.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

One more breath... breathing in single-minded presence... hold... and as you exhale, let your eyes close and distractions fade.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let the golden light of focus begin at your head. This light clears distractions. Scalp warming. Mental noise quieting. Your family becoming the only thing that matters.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The warmth flows through your body. Your eyes, no longer pulled to screens. Your mind, no longer divided. Your whole being focused on those you love.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Now the staircase. Twenty steps down to undivided attention.

Twenty, nineteen, eighteen, seventeen, sixteen... distractions fading.
Fifteen, fourteen, thirteen, twelve, eleven... focus deepening.
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six... presence strengthening.
Five, four, three, two, one... complete attention achieved.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

You are in a place of undivided focus. Here, nothing competes with your family. Here, they have all of you.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Modern life offers endless distractions. Devices, work, news, entertainment. These are not evil, but they can become thieves—stealing time and attention from what matters most.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The phone is the primary thief. How many family moments have been interrupted, fragmented, or missed entirely because of a glowing screen?

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Work thoughts are another distraction. Your body is home, but your mind is at the office. Your family gets the leftover attention after work has taken its share.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Worry steals presence too. Anxious thoughts about tomorrow rob today. Your family speaks to you, but you are somewhere else, solving imaginary problems.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The scripture says, Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. Your family is your treasure. Your heart should be with them.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let us build a practice of putting away distractions. When you come home, or when family time begins, there is a ritual.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

First, devices go away. Not on the table. Not in your pocket. Somewhere you cannot see them. Out of sight reduces their pull.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Second, take a transitional breath. Close your eyes for one second. Say to yourself: I am here now. This mental reset shifts you from work mode to family mode.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Third, make eye contact with each family member. Really see them. This connects you instantly.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Fourth, ask a genuine question. Not how was your day as you walk past, but a real inquiry that waits for an answer.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

When distracting thoughts arise during family time—and they will—notice them, and gently release them. Not now. Later. This moment is for my family.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Imagine yourself practicing this now. You come home. Phone goes away. Breath. Eyes on family. Genuine greeting. Presence achieved.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

See your family's response. They notice. They feel valued. Connection deepens. This is the power of undivided attention.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

From now on, you will put away distractions during family time. Not perfectly—no one is perfect. But intentionally. Repeatedly. As a practice.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The habit will grow. Presence will become easier. Your family will become accustomed to having all of you—as they deserve.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Rest in undivided attention now. Feel how it opens your heart. This is the way you were meant to connect.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

It is time to return. As I count from one to ten, you will become alert, carrying the commitment to undivided attention with you.

One... beginning to return.
Two... feeling focused and present.
Three... becoming more aware.
Four... refreshed and determined.
Five... halfway back.
Six... alertness increasing.
Seven... feeling wonderful.
Eight... almost there.
Nine... nearly fully awake.
Ten... eyes open, fully alert. Put away distractions, Austin. Give your family your full attention.
