=== PRE-TALK / SETTLING (2-3 minutes) ===

Welcome back, Austin. Today we address the barriers to presence—the distractions that steal you from your family. You will learn to put them away and truly be there.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Last session, you discovered the gift of presence and installed your hand-over-heart anchor. Today we go deeper, identifying what pulls your attention away and building systems to protect family time.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Modern life offers endless distractions. Devices, work, news, entertainment—these are not evil, but they can become thieves. Thieves that steal time and attention from what matters most.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You have already begun putting distractions away by being here. No phone. No television. Just you, developing the capacity to be fully present. Let us continue building this capacity.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Find a comfortable position. Allow your body to settle. This time is sacred—a gift to yourself and to your family. Let us begin.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== INDUCTION - Eye Fatigue with Diaphragmatic Breathing (10-12 minutes) ===

Begin by finding a spot on the ceiling or wall, slightly above your natural line of sight. A spot that requires you to look upward without straining your neck.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Focus on that spot. Keep your eyes fixed there as you begin to breathe deeply. Diaphragmatic breathing—belly expanding as you breathe in, sinking as you breathe out.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Breathe in through your nose... belly rising gently... hold for a moment... and release through your mouth. With this exhale, feel distractions beginning to fade.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Continue gazing at that spot. Notice how your eyes begin to feel. A slight strain. A heaviness developing. This is natural and welcome. With each breath, this heaviness increases.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Another breath now... deeper than before... belly expanding... hold... and release. Distractions falling away with each exhale.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Keep your eyes on that spot. They are growing heavier. The muscles around your eyes are tiring. Some of you may notice a watering of the eyes. Others feel a pulling sensation. Both are signs that relaxation is developing.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Breathe in once more... letting the breath fill your entire chest cavity... hold... and as you exhale, notice your eyes wanting to close. When the desire becomes strong enough, allow them to close naturally.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

If your eyes have not yet closed, take another breath and let them close with the exhale. There is no rush. Your eyes will close when they are ready.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Eyes now closed... feel the relief. The muscles that were straining are now resting. This is the first letting go—like putting down a phone and choosing presence instead.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Now that your eyes are closed, bring your attention to your breathing. Allow each breath to deepen the relaxation flowing through your body.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

With your next breath, focus on your scalp. Feel it softening, relaxing. Any tension held there simply melting away. Warmth spreading across the top of your head like a golden light.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

This golden light represents focused attention. It flows down to your forehead now. Feel the muscles of your forehead smoothing out. All worry lines dissolving. Your forehead becoming cool, calm, completely relaxed.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Down to your eyes now—those tired muscles resting deeply. Your eyelids becoming wonderfully heavy. As though tiny weights are gently pressing them down. So heavy that you have no desire to open them.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The relaxation spreads to your cheeks and jaw. Your jaw becoming slack. Your teeth parting slightly. All the tension that accumulates in your jaw throughout the day—released now. Melting away.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Down into your neck. Feel each vertebra of your neck relaxing. The muscles on the sides and back of your neck becoming loose like warm rubber. Your head feeling balanced and supported.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The wave of relaxation flows into your shoulders. Shoulders are where we carry so much of life's burden. Feel yours dropping now. Releasing their load. Becoming soft and heavy.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Down through your arms. The relaxation flowing like warm honey through your upper arms... your elbows... your forearms. Into your wrists and hands. Each finger becoming loose and heavy.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Your chest now. Feel your breathing becoming even slower, even deeper. Your heart beating calmly, steadily. A sense of peace filling your entire chest cavity. Your family becoming the only thing that matters.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The warmth spreads through your stomach. Any knots or butterflies dissolving completely. Your stomach becoming soft and relaxed. All tension released.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Into your lower back—that area that works so hard. Feel it softening. The muscles along your spine releasing their grip. Your entire back sinking into whatever supports you.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Through your hips now, releasing any tightness held there. Down into your thighs. Your large leg muscles becoming completely limp, loose, and heavy. Like lead weights.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Past your knees, into your calves. These muscles that carry you through each day—resting now. Completely at peace.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Into your ankles, your feet, your toes. Every muscle, every joint, every cell of your body now bathed in deep relaxation. The golden light of focused attention has filled you completely.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

You are deeply relaxed, Austin. Your body is at peace. Your mind is calm and receptive. With each breath, you go deeper. The better you feel, the deeper you go. The deeper you go, the more naturally you can put distractions aside.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== DEEPENING - 20-Step Staircase (8-10 minutes) ===

In your mind's eye, you find yourself at the top of a beautiful staircase. This staircase has twenty steps, and it leads down to a place of undivided attention—a sanctuary where nothing competes with your family.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The banister is smooth beneath your hand. The steps are solid and safe. With each step you descend, you will go twice as deep into hypnosis, and your ability to put away distractions will double.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Step twenty. Taking the first step down. Feeling relaxation deepen. Distractions beginning to release.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step nineteen. Going deeper. The pull of devices weakening.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step eighteen. Deeper still. Work thoughts finding their proper place.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step seventeen. Every step takes you deeper. Every step strengthens your focus.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step sixteen. Mind quieting. Family coming into sharper focus.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step fifteen. Deeper now. Distractions losing their grip.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step fourteen. Halfway there. So peaceful already.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step thirteen. Deeper than before. Single-minded attention developing.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step twelve. Your subconscious opening to receive.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step eleven. So peaceful. So ready to be undistracted.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step ten. Entering the deepest levels now. The sanctuary of undivided attention is near.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step nine. Every suggestion you receive will become part of you.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step eight. Going deeper still.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step seven. Profound focus developing naturally.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step six. Almost there, Austin.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step five. So deep now. Completely ready.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step four. Deeper than you have ever been.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step three. The sanctuary is just ahead.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step two. One more step.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step one. You step off the staircase into the sanctuary of undivided attention. You are in the deepest state of hypnosis. Here, nothing competes with your family. Everything you hear will be absorbed completely by your subconscious mind.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== THERAPEUTIC CONTENT (15-18 minutes) ===

You remain in complete control. Your deeper mind will accept only the suggestions that align with your values and serve your growth. Everything else simply fades away.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

--- The Thieves of Presence ---

Austin, in this sanctuary, you can see clearly what steals your attention from your family. Let us name these thieves so they lose their power over you.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The phone is the primary thief. It sits in your pocket, always ready to pull you away. A notification sounds, and before you even think, your hand reaches for it. How many family moments have been interrupted, fragmented, or missed entirely because of a glowing screen?

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The phone promises connection but often delivers disconnection. You are texting someone far away while ignoring someone in the same room. You are checking social media while your child waits to show you something. The irony is painful when you see it clearly.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Work thoughts are another thief. Your body comes home, but your mind stays at the office. You are physically present at dinner, but mentally solving a problem from work. Your family gets the leftover attention after work has taken its share.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This is understandable—work is important. But without boundaries, work can consume everything. The worries and tasks multiply until there is no mental space left for family.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Worry steals presence too. Anxious thoughts about tomorrow rob today. Your child is speaking to you, but you are somewhere else, rehearsing imaginary problems. Your body is on the couch, but your mind is in next week.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Entertainment can be a thief as well. Television, games, social media—these are not bad in themselves. But when they fill every spare moment, when they become the default activity, there is no space left for the deeper connection your family needs.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- The Cost of Distraction ---

The cost of distraction is high. When you are consistently distracted around your family, they learn a painful lesson: I am not as important as that screen. I do not hold Dad's attention. Something else always comes first.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Children internalize this. They may not say it, but they feel it. Over time, they stop trying to get your attention because they have learned it is not really available.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Spouses feel it too. The romance that once held your full attention now competes with dozens of other inputs. Love can grow cold when it is chronically divided.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The scripture says, "Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also." Your family is your treasure. Your heart should be with them.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Building a Transition Ritual ---

Let us now build a practice of putting away distractions. When you come home, or when family time begins, there will be a ritual that shifts you from distracted mode to present mode.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

First, devices go away. Not on the table where you can see them. Not in your pocket where you can feel them vibrate. Somewhere out of sight. In a drawer. In another room. On a charger in the garage. Out of sight reduces their pull.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This is not forever—just for designated family time. The phone will still be there afterward. The messages will wait. Nothing on that device is more urgent than the people in front of you.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Second, take a transitional breath. Close your eyes for one moment. Say to yourself: I am here now. This mental reset shifts you from work mode to family mode, from distracted mode to present mode.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Place your hand over your heart as you do this. Activate your presence anchor. Feel the shift happen in your body.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Third, make eye contact with each family member. Really see them. This connects you instantly. It says: I am here. I see you.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Fourth, ask a genuine question. Not "how was your day" as you walk past, but a real inquiry that waits for an answer. What was the best part of today? What are you working on? Tell me something.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This four-step ritual takes less than two minutes. Device away. Transitional breath with anchor. Eye contact. Genuine question. But it transforms the quality of your presence.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Managing Distracting Thoughts ---

Even when devices are away, distracting thoughts can arise. Work problems surface. Worries appear. Your mind wanders to things undone.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When this happens—and it will—notice the thought, and gently release it. Not now. Later. This moment is for my family.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You are not suppressing the thought or pretending it does not exist. You are acknowledging it and choosing to address it later. You are setting a boundary around family time.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Some people find it helpful to keep a notepad nearby. When a work thought intrudes, jot it down in a word or two, then let it go. It is captured. It will not be forgotten. But right now, family time is protected.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Visualizing Your Transition ---

Let us practice this transition now. Imagine yourself arriving home. Perhaps you are pulling into the driveway or walking through the door.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

See yourself taking out your phone and putting it somewhere out of sight. A drawer. A basket by the door. Somewhere it cannot call to you.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Now take a transitional breath. Place your hand over your heart. Say internally: I am here now. Feel the shift from work mode to family mode.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

See your family. Look at each person. Make eye contact. Really see them.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Ask a genuine question. Wait for the answer. Listen fully.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Feel the connection. You are present. They feel it. Something is different. Something is better.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- The Anchor Reinforcement ---

Place your hand over your heart now.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

This anchor now carries even more power. It carries the ability to put away distractions. When you use this anchor, distractions naturally recede. Focus naturally sharpens. Presence naturally activates.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Use this anchor every time you transition into family time. Before dinner. After work. On the weekend when you are with your children. The anchor reminds your subconscious: Now is the time for presence.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Release your hand. The anchor is strengthened.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- The Freedom of Focus ---

There is something freeing about putting away distractions. When you are fully present, you are no longer pulled in multiple directions. The constant background anxiety of divided attention disappears.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You can actually enjoy the moment. You can actually hear what your child is saying. You can actually look at your spouse and feel love without the static of distraction.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This is how life was meant to be lived—fully present, one moment at a time. Not scattered across a dozen inputs, but gathered into whatever is before you.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Habit Formation ---

From now on, you will practice putting away distractions during family time. Not perfectly at first—no one is perfect. But intentionally. Repeatedly. As a practice that grows stronger.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The habit will form. After a few weeks, it will feel strange to have your phone out during dinner. It will feel wrong to be half-distracted while your child talks to you. Presence will become the norm.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your family will notice the change. They may not say anything at first. But they will feel it. They will respond to it. Connection will deepen as distraction decreases.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Sealing the Commitment ---

Rest in undivided attention now. Feel how it opens your heart. This is the way you were meant to connect with your family.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Distractions will always be available. There will always be something to check, something to worry about, something to do. But your family needs you now. They deserve your attention now.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The decision to put away distractions is a decision to love. It says: You are more important than anything on that screen. You are worth my full attention.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== POST-HYPNOTIC SUGGESTIONS (2-3 minutes) ===

Your subconscious now holds the practice of putting away distractions. It understands the thieves of presence and how to defeat them.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

From now on, you will naturally put your phone away during family time. The pull of devices will weaken. Presence will come more easily.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your transition ritual will become automatic. Device away. Transitional breath with anchor. Eye contact. Genuine question. Family mode activated.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When distracting thoughts arise, you will notice them, note them, and release them. Not now. Later. Family time is protected.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your family will have your undivided attention—and they will feel the difference. Connection will deepen. Love will grow.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== EMERGENCE (3-5 minutes) ===

It is time to return to full awareness, carrying your commitment to undivided attention with you.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

In a moment, I will count from one to ten. With each number, you will become more alert, more awake, while your ability to put away distractions remains permanently installed.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One. Beginning the journey back. Undivided attention sealed within you.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Two. Feeling energy returning to your body. Ready to be present.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Three. Your mind clearing. The transition ritual installed.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Four. More alert now. Focused on your family.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Five. Halfway back. Feeling wonderful.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Six. More alert with each breath. Distractions will wait.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Seven. Almost there. Presence strengthening.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Eight. Eyes preparing to open. Heart full of love.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Nine. Nearly fully awake. Taking a deep, refreshing breath.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Ten. Eyes open, fully alert, completely refreshed, and ready to be undistracted.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Welcome back, Austin. You have taken another important step—learning to put away what steals your attention from your family.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Remember the ritual: device away, transitional breath with anchor, eye contact, genuine question. Practice it today and every day.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Your family deserves your full attention. Now you know how to give it.
