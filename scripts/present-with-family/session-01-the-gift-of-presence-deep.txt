Duration: ~38 minutes
Voice: Male, British accent, warm and encouraging

[BEGIN SCRIPT]

Welcome, Austin. You have come seeking to be more present with your family. This is one of the most precious gifts you can give them—and yourself.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Find your comfortable position. Take a deep breath in... hold gently... and release, bringing your attention fully here.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Another breath, deeper... letting go of everything that pulls you away... hold... and release, presence building.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

One more breath... breathing in connection... hold... and as you exhale, let your eyes close and your heart open to your family.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let a warm, golden light begin at the top of your head. This light is love and presence. Scalp warming. Distractions fading. Your family coming into focus.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The warmth flows through your face, your eyes that will truly see them, your ears that will truly hear them. Through your neck, shoulders, arms that can hold and embrace.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Through your chest where love lives. Through your stomach, your back. Through your legs, your feet that can walk beside them. Your whole being prepared for presence.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Now the staircase. Twenty steps down to the deepest presence.

Twenty, nineteen, eighteen, seventeen, sixteen... love deepening.
Fifteen, fourteen, thirteen, twelve, eleven... presence growing.
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six... distractions fading.
Five, four, three, two, one... complete presence achieved.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

You are in a place of pure presence. Here, your family is all that matters. Here, you see them with new eyes.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Your family needs your presence more than almost anything else you can give them. Not just your physical presence—your full attention, your emotional availability, your engaged heart.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Children spell love T-I-M-E. But not just any time—present time. When you are with them but distracted, they notice. When you are truly there, they bloom.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Spouses need presence too. The relationship that began with rapt attention can wither under divided focus. Presence says: You still matter. You are still my priority.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Parents and siblings, if they are in your life, deserve moments of full attention. Relationships across generations are nourished by presence.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The Savior said, Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not. He made time for those others dismissed. He was fully present with whoever was before Him.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You can learn this presence. It is not a personality trait you lack. It is a skill you can develop, a habit you can build.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Presence begins with intention. You must choose to be present. It does not happen automatically. It is a deliberate act of love.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let us practice now. Bring to mind a family member. See their face clearly. Feel your love for them.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Now imagine being with them with your full attention. Looking at them when they speak. Listening completely. Not thinking about what you will say next. Just receiving them.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Feel how different this is from partial presence. The connection is deeper. The love is felt. They know they matter.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

From now on, you will give your family the gift of presence. When you are with them, you will truly be with them. Not half there. Fully present.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This will require setting aside distractions. Devices, work thoughts, worries. These can wait. Your family cannot always wait. Time passes.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

In the sessions ahead, you will learn specific skills: managing distractions, quality time, emotional availability, creating memories. But today, the foundation is laid. You understand the value of presence.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Rest in this intention for a moment. Your family is precious. Your time with them is finite. Presence is how you honor both truths.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

It is time to return now. As I count from one to ten, you will become alert, carrying the commitment to presence with you.

One... beginning to return.
Two... feeling loving and present.
Three... becoming more aware.
Four... refreshed and committed.
Five... halfway back.
Six... alertness increasing.
Seven... feeling wonderful.
Eight... almost there.
Nine... nearly fully awake.
Ten... eyes open, fully alert. Give your family your presence, Austin. It is the greatest gift.
