=== PRE-TALK / SETTLING (2-3 minutes) ===

Welcome, Austin. You have come seeking to be more present with your family. This is one of the most precious gifts you can give them—and yourself.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

In our busy, distracted world, true presence has become rare. We are often physically near our loved ones while our minds are elsewhere—on work, on devices, on worries. Our bodies occupy the same room, but our attention is scattered across a thousand concerns.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Today we begin changing that. Over these six sessions, you will develop the capacity for genuine presence with your family. You will learn to be fully there—not half-there, not mostly-there, but completely present when you are with those you love.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This is not about adding more to your schedule. It is about transforming the quality of the time you already spend. When you are present, fifteen minutes of connection can be more nourishing than hours of divided attention.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Find a comfortable position now. Allow your body to settle. This time is yours to become the father, the husband, the family member you want to be. Let us begin.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== INDUCTION - Eye Fatigue with Diaphragmatic Breathing (10-12 minutes) ===

Begin by finding a spot on the ceiling or wall, slightly above your natural line of sight. A spot that requires you to look upward without straining your neck.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Focus on that spot. Keep your eyes fixed there as you begin to breathe deeply. Diaphragmatic breathing—belly expanding as you breathe in, sinking as you breathe out.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Breathe in through your nose... belly rising gently... hold for a moment... and release through your mouth. With this exhale, feel your family coming into focus in your heart.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Continue gazing at that spot. Notice how your eyes begin to feel. A slight strain. A heaviness developing. This is natural and welcome. With each breath, this heaviness increases.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Another breath now... deeper than before... belly expanding... hold... and release. Your capacity for presence is growing.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Keep your eyes on that spot. They are growing heavier. The muscles around your eyes are tiring. Some of you may notice a watering of the eyes. Others feel a pulling sensation. Both are signs that relaxation is developing.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Breathe in once more... letting the breath fill your entire chest cavity... hold... and as you exhale, notice your eyes wanting to close. When the desire becomes strong enough, allow them to close naturally.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

If your eyes have not yet closed, take another breath and let them close with the exhale. There is no rush. Your eyes will close when they are ready.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Eyes now closed... feel the relief. The muscles that were straining are now resting. This is the first surrender—letting go of visual distraction to focus inward.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Now that your eyes are closed, bring your attention to your breathing. Allow each breath to deepen the relaxation flowing through your body.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

With your next breath, focus on your scalp. Feel it softening, relaxing. Any tension held there simply melting away. Warmth spreading across the top of your head like a golden light.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

This golden light is the light of presence. It flows down to your forehead now. Feel the muscles of your forehead smoothing out. All worry lines dissolving. Your forehead becoming cool, calm, completely relaxed.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Down to your eyes now—those tired muscles resting deeply. Your eyelids becoming wonderfully heavy. As though tiny weights are gently pressing them down. So heavy that you have no desire to open them.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The relaxation spreads to your cheeks and jaw. Your jaw becoming slack. Your teeth parting slightly. All the tension that accumulates in your jaw throughout the day—released now. Melting away.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Down into your neck. Feel each vertebra of your neck relaxing. The muscles on the sides and back of your neck becoming loose like warm rubber. Your head feeling balanced and supported.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The wave of relaxation flows into your shoulders. Shoulders are where we carry so much of life's burden. Feel yours dropping now. Releasing their load. Becoming soft and heavy.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Down through your arms. The relaxation flowing like warm honey through your upper arms... your elbows... your forearms. Into your wrists and hands. Each finger becoming loose and heavy.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Your chest now. Feel your breathing becoming even slower, even deeper. Your heart beating calmly, steadily. A sense of peace filling your entire chest cavity. Love for your family expanding.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The warmth spreads through your stomach. Any knots or butterflies dissolving completely. Your stomach becoming soft and relaxed. All tension released.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Into your lower back—that area that works so hard. Feel it softening. The muscles along your spine releasing their grip. Your entire back sinking into whatever supports you.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Through your hips now, releasing any tightness held there. Down into your thighs. Your large leg muscles becoming completely limp, loose, and heavy. Like lead weights.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Past your knees, into your calves. These muscles that carry you through each day—resting now. Completely at peace.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Into your ankles, your feet, your toes. Every muscle, every joint, every cell of your body now bathed in deep relaxation. The golden light of presence has filled you completely.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

You are deeply relaxed, Austin. Your body is at peace. Your mind is calm and receptive. With each breath, you go deeper. The better you feel, the deeper you go. The deeper you go, the more your capacity for presence expands.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== DEEPENING - 20-Step Staircase (8-10 minutes) ===

In your mind's eye, you find yourself at the top of a beautiful staircase. This staircase has twenty steps, and it leads down to a place of pure presence—a sanctuary where your family is all that matters.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The banister is smooth beneath your hand. The steps are solid and safe. With each step you descend, you will go twice as deep into hypnosis, and your capacity for family presence will double.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Step twenty. Taking the first step down. Feeling relaxation deepen. Presence beginning to awaken.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step nineteen. Going deeper. Your heart opening toward your family.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step eighteen. Deeper still. Distractions falling away.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step fifteen. Deeper now. Love for your family expanding.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step three. The sanctuary is just ahead.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step two. One more step.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step one. You step off the staircase into the sanctuary of presence. You are in the deepest state of hypnosis. Here, your capacity for family presence is unlimited. Everything you hear will be absorbed completely by your subconscious mind.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== THERAPEUTIC CONTENT (15-18 minutes) ===

--- Understanding the Gift of Presence ---

Austin, in this sanctuary, you can see clearly what your family truly needs from you. Not more money. Not more things. Not even more time. What they need most is your presence—your full, undivided attention when you are with them.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Children spell love T-I-M-E. But not just any time—present time. When you are with them but distracted, they notice. They feel it. Something is missing. They may not have words for it, but they know when they do not have all of you.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When you are truly present, however, everything changes. Your child's story about their day becomes fascinating. The moment becomes rich. Connection flows naturally. They bloom under the warmth of your undivided attention.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Your spouse needs presence too. The relationship that began with rapt attention—with hanging on every word, with deep interest in every thought—can wither under years of divided focus. Life gets busy. Distractions multiply. And slowly, presence erodes.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

But presence can be restored. Every moment of full attention says to your spouse: You still matter. After all these years, you are still my priority. I choose you. This message, communicated through presence, nourishes love.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Parents and siblings, if they are in your life, also deserve moments of full attention. The relationships across generations—these too are nourished by presence. Time is finite. Every present moment is a gift.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- The Savior as the Model of Presence ---

The Savior was the perfect model of presence. When He was with someone, He was fully with them. He was not thinking about the next town. He was not distracted by the crowd. He was completely present with the person before Him.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

He said, "Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not." And when the children came, He did not rush them. He blessed them one by one. He gave each child His full attention. He saw them.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When the woman with the issue of blood touched His garment in a pressing crowd, He stopped. He could have kept walking. But He stopped, found her, looked at her, spoke to her. In that moment, she had all of Him.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This is the presence you are learning. Not perfection—the Savior was divine. But the direction. The intention. The commitment to be fully there with whoever is before you.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Presence is a Skill ---

Here is good news: presence is not a personality trait you either have or lack. It is a skill you can develop. It is a habit you can build. It is a muscle you can strengthen.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Some people seem naturally present. But look closer—they have simply practiced. They have trained themselves to focus. They have built habits of attention. You can do the same.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Every time you choose presence over distraction, the neural pathways of attention strengthen. Every time you put down the phone, look someone in the eyes, and truly listen—you are training your brain for presence.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This training becomes easier over time. Presence becomes more natural. What once required effort becomes automatic. You become someone who is simply present with their family.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Presence Begins with Intention ---

Presence begins with intention. You must choose to be present. It does not happen automatically. In fact, the default in our distracted world is partial presence—divided attention, fragmented focus.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

So you must make a deliberate choice. When you walk through the door after work, you must intentionally shift from work mode to family mode. When you sit down to dinner, you must consciously decide: I am here now.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This intention is not a one-time decision. It is a moment-by-moment choice. When your mind wanders, you notice and gently return. When a distraction pulls, you resist and refocus. Intention is the engine of presence.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Installing the Presence Anchor ---

Let us now install an anchor for presence. Place your hand gently over your heart.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Feel the warmth of your hand on your chest. Feel your heartbeat beneath your palm. This is your presence anchor.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Whenever you place your hand over your heart and take a slow breath, your capacity for presence will activate. All the resources from these sessions will become available. Your attention will sharpen. Your heart will open.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Use this anchor when you come home to your family. Use it when you sit down to dinner. Use it when your child wants to tell you something. Use it when your spouse needs your attention.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Hand over heart. Slow breath. Presence activated.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Release your hand now. The anchor is installed. It will strengthen with each use.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Practicing Presence Now ---

Let us practice presence now. Bring to mind a family member—perhaps the one who most needs your attention. See their face clearly in your mind's eye.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Notice the details. Their eyes. Their expression. The way they look when they want your attention.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Feel your love for this person. Let it rise in your chest. This love is the foundation of presence. You want to be present because you love them.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Now imagine being with them with your full attention. You are looking at them when they speak. You are listening completely—not thinking about what you will say next, not waiting for your turn to talk. Just receiving them.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your phone is nowhere in sight. Work thoughts are put away. You are completely there. Just you and them, in this moment.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Feel how different this is from partial presence. The connection is deeper. The love is felt. They know they matter. They feel seen. They feel valued.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

This is what you will give your family. Not perfectly, not always—but intentionally, regularly, as a practice. And it will transform your relationships.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- What Presence Requires ---

Presence requires setting aside distractions. Devices, work thoughts, worries—these can wait. They will still be there after family time. But your family cannot always wait. Time passes. Children grow. Moments slip away.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You are not choosing between important and unimportant. Work is important. Responsibilities are important. But in the moments you give to family, family becomes the priority. Everything else takes second place.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This is not neglecting other responsibilities. It is honoring the most important one. No other success can compensate for failure in the home. Presence is how you succeed at home.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Previewing Your Journey ---

In the sessions ahead, you will learn specific skills. How to put away distractions and transition into family mode. How to give quality time tailored to each family member. How to be emotionally available. How to create lasting memories.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

But today, the foundation is laid. You understand the value of presence. You have installed the anchor. You have practiced being fully there.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You are on your way to becoming the present father, husband, and family member you want to be. This is one of the most worthwhile journeys you can take.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Sealing the Commitment ---

Rest in this intention for a moment. Your family is precious. Your time with them is finite. Presence is how you honor both truths.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Every moment of presence says: You matter to me. You are worth my attention. I choose you.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

These words, spoken through presence, build your family. They create security in your children. They nurture love with your spouse. They form the bonds that last forever.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== POST-HYPNOTIC SUGGESTIONS (2-3 minutes) ===

Your subconscious now holds the gift of presence. It understands what your family needs. It knows that your attention is your most precious gift.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

From now on, you will naturally choose presence when you are with your family. When you walk through the door, you will shift into family mode. When you sit with a loved one, you will be fully there.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your hand-over-heart anchor will activate presence instantly. Each time you use it, it becomes stronger. Presence will become your natural way of being with family.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Distractions will lose their grip on you during family time. Phones, work thoughts, worries—they will wait. Your family will have all of you.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You will notice when your attention wanders and gently return. This is not failure—it is the practice of presence. Return is the skill.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== EMERGENCE (3-5 minutes) ===

It is time to return to full awareness, carrying your commitment to presence with you.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

In a moment, I will count from one to ten. With each number, you will become more alert, more awake, while your capacity for presence remains permanently installed.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One. Beginning the journey back. Presence sealed within you.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Two. Feeling energy returning to your body. Love for your family strong.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Three. Your mind clearing. The commitment solid.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Four. More alert now. Eager to be present.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Five. Halfway back. Feeling wonderful.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Six. More alert with each breath. Ready for your family.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Seven. Almost there. Presence ready to give.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Eight. Eyes preparing to open. Heart full.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Nine. Nearly fully awake. Taking a deep, refreshing breath.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Ten. Eyes open, fully alert, completely refreshed, and ready to be present.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Welcome back, Austin. You have begun one of the most important journeys—learning to truly be with your family.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Remember your anchor: hand over heart, slow breath, presence activated. Use it today. Use it every day.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Your family is waiting for your presence. It is the greatest gift you can give them. Go give it freely.
