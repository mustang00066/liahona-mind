[BEGIN SCRIPT]

Welcome back, Austin. Today we address barriers to presence. The distractions that steal you from your family. You will learn to put them away.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Put away all devices. Take a deep breath in... hold... and release, already more present.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Another breath, deeper... letting go of what pulls attention... hold... and release.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One more breath... eyes closing, distractions fading.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let the golden light of focus clear distractions. Head to toe. Your family becoming the only thing that matters.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Descend now. Ten to one. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Complete attention.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Modern life offers endless distractions. Devices, work, news. These can become thieves—stealing time from what matters most.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The phone is the primary thief. How many family moments have been missed for a glowing screen?

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Work thoughts steal presence too. Your body is home, but your mind is at the office.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The scripture says, Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. Your family is your treasure.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Build a ritual: First, devices go away. Out of sight. Second, take a transitional breath. I am here now.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Third, make eye contact with each family member. Fourth, ask a genuine question that waits for an answer.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When distracting thoughts arise, notice and release. Not now. Later. This moment is for my family.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Imagine coming home. Phone away. Breath. Eyes on family. Genuine greeting. Presence achieved.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One... beginning to return.
Two... feeling focused and present.
Three... becoming alert.
Four... refreshed and determined.
Five... eyes open, fully alert. Put away distractions, Austin. Give your family your full attention.
