=== PRE-TALK / SETTLING (1-2 minutes) ===

Welcome back, Austin. Today we address the barriers to presence—the distractions that steal you from your family. You will learn to put them away and truly be there.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Modern life offers endless distractions. Devices, work, news, entertainment—these can become thieves, stealing time and attention from what matters most.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You have already begun putting distractions away by being here. Let us continue building this capacity.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== INDUCTION - Rapid Relaxation with Breathing (5-6 minutes) ===

Take a deep breath now. Diaphragmatic breathing—belly expanding as you breathe in, sinking as you breathe out.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Breathe in through your nose... belly rising gently... hold for a moment... and release through your mouth. With this exhale, feel distractions beginning to fade.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Another breath... deeper... and as you exhale, allow your eyes to close naturally.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let a golden light begin at the top of your head. This light represents focused attention. It warms your scalp. Relaxes your forehead. Softens the muscles around your eyes.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your eyelids becoming wonderfully heavy. As though gently stuck together.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The golden light flows down. Neck becoming loose like rubber bands. Shoulders dropping—releasing all tension.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Arms becoming limp, loose, and heavy. All the way down to your hands.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Through your chest, your heart opening. Through your stomach, all tension dissolving.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Through your legs, becoming heavy like lead. Down to your feet. Your whole body relaxed.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The better you feel, the deeper you go. The deeper you go, the more naturally you can put distractions aside.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== DEEPENING (3-4 minutes) ===

Imagine yourself at the top of a staircase... ten steps leading down to a sanctuary of undivided attention.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Ten. Stepping down. Distractions beginning to release.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Nine. Deeper. The pull of devices weakening.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Eight. Work thoughts finding their proper place.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Seven. Deeper still.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Six. Halfway there.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Five. So deep. Distractions losing their grip.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Four. Almost there.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Three. Single-minded attention developing.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Two. One more step.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

One. You step into the sanctuary of undivided attention. Everything you hear will be absorbed completely.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== THERAPEUTIC CONTENT (8-10 minutes) ===

--- The Thieves of Presence ---

Austin, let us name the thieves of presence so they lose their power.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The phone is the primary thief. How many family moments have been interrupted for a glowing screen? The phone promises connection but often delivers disconnection—texting someone far away while ignoring someone in the same room.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Work thoughts are another thief. Your body comes home, but your mind stays at the office. Your family gets leftover attention.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Worry steals presence too. Anxious thoughts about tomorrow rob today.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The scripture says, "Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also." Your family is your treasure. Your heart should be with them.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Building a Transition Ritual ---

Let us build a practice of putting away distractions.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

First, devices go away. Not on the table. Somewhere out of sight. In a drawer. In another room. Out of sight reduces their pull.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Second, take a transitional breath. Place your hand over your heart. Say internally: I am here now. This shifts you from work mode to family mode.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Third, make eye contact with each family member. Really see them.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Fourth, ask a genuine question that waits for an answer.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Device away. Transitional breath with anchor. Eye contact. Genuine question. This ritual transforms your presence.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Managing Distracting Thoughts ---

When distracting thoughts arise during family time, notice the thought and gently release it. Not now. Later. This moment is for my family.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You are not suppressing the thought—you are setting a boundary around family time. It will be addressed later.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Visualizing Your Transition ---

Imagine arriving home. See yourself putting your phone somewhere out of sight.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Take a transitional breath. Place your hand over your heart. Feel the shift to family mode.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Look at each family member. Make eye contact. Ask a genuine question. Listen fully.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Feel the connection. You are present. They feel it. Something is different. Something is better.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Anchor Reinforcement ---

Place your hand over your heart now.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

This anchor now carries the ability to put away distractions. When you use it, focus naturally sharpens. Presence naturally activates.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Use this anchor every time you transition into family time.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Release your hand. The anchor is strengthened.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- The Freedom of Focus ---

There is something freeing about putting away distractions. When fully present, you are no longer pulled in multiple directions. You can actually enjoy the moment. You can actually hear what your child is saying.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This is how life was meant to be lived—fully present, one moment at a time.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Sealing the Commitment ---

The decision to put away distractions is a decision to love. It says: You are more important than anything on that screen.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your family will notice. Connection will deepen as distraction decreases.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== POST-HYPNOTIC SUGGESTIONS (1 minute) ===

Your subconscious now holds the practice of putting away distractions.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

From now on, you will naturally put your phone away during family time. Your transition ritual will become automatic.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

When distracting thoughts arise, you will notice them and release them. Family time is protected.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== EMERGENCE (2-3 minutes) ===

It is time to return to full awareness, carrying your commitment to undivided attention.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

I will count from one to five. With each number, you become more alert while your ability to put away distractions remains installed.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

One. Beginning to return. Undivided attention sealed.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Two. Energy returning. Ready to be present.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Three. More alert. The transition ritual installed.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Four. Almost fully awake. Focused on your family.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Five. Eyes open, fully awake, completely alert, and ready to give your undivided attention.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Welcome back, Austin. You have learned to put away what steals your attention from your family.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Remember the ritual: device away, transitional breath with anchor, eye contact, genuine question.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Your family deserves your full attention. Now you know how to give it.
