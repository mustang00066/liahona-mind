=== PRE-TALK / SETTLING (2-3 minutes) ===

Welcome back, Austin. Today we focus on emotional availability—being present not just physically, but emotionally. Your family needs access to your heart, not just your body.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

In previous sessions, you discovered presence, learned to put away distractions, and practiced giving quality time. Today we go deeper—learning to be emotionally open, responsive, and connected.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Being emotionally available means your family can reach you. They can share their feelings and be received. They can come to you with joy or with pain, and you will be there—truly there—with them.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This is perhaps the deepest form of presence. It requires vulnerability. It requires lowering walls. But the connection it creates is profound and lasting.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Find a comfortable position now. Allow your body to settle. You are preparing to open your heart to your family in a new way. Let us begin.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== INDUCTION - Eye Fatigue with Diaphragmatic Breathing (10-12 minutes) ===

Begin by finding a spot on the ceiling or wall, slightly above your natural line of sight. A spot that requires you to look upward without straining your neck.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Focus on that spot. Keep your eyes fixed there as you begin to breathe deeply. Diaphragmatic breathing—belly expanding as you breathe in, sinking as you breathe out.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Breathe in through your nose... belly rising gently... hold for a moment... and release through your mouth. With this exhale, feel your heart beginning to soften.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Continue gazing at that spot. Notice how your eyes begin to feel. A slight strain. A heaviness developing. This is natural and welcome. With each breath, this heaviness increases.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Another breath now... deeper than before... belly expanding... hold... and release. Emotional walls beginning to lower.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Keep your eyes on that spot. They are growing heavier. The muscles around your eyes are tiring. Some of you may notice a watering of the eyes. Others feel a pulling sensation. Both are signs that relaxation is developing.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Breathe in once more... letting the breath fill your entire chest cavity... hold... and as you exhale, notice your eyes wanting to close. When the desire becomes strong enough, allow them to close naturally.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

If your eyes have not yet closed, take another breath and let them close with the exhale. There is no rush. Your eyes will close when they are ready.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Eyes now closed... feel the relief. The muscles that were straining are now resting. This is like dropping your guard—allowing yourself to be open and available.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Now that your eyes are closed, bring your attention to your breathing. Allow each breath to deepen the relaxation flowing through your body.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

With your next breath, focus on your scalp. Feel it softening, relaxing. Any tension held there simply melting away. Warmth spreading across the top of your head like a golden light.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

This golden light is the light of emotional openness. It flows down to your forehead now. Feel the muscles of your forehead smoothing out. All worry lines dissolving. Your forehead becoming cool, calm, completely relaxed.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Down to your eyes now—those tired muscles resting deeply. Your eyelids becoming wonderfully heavy. As though tiny weights are gently pressing them down. So heavy that you have no desire to open them.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The relaxation spreads to your cheeks and jaw. Your jaw becoming slack. Your teeth parting slightly. All the tension that accumulates in your jaw throughout the day—released now. Melting away.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Down into your neck. Feel each vertebra of your neck relaxing. The muscles on the sides and back of your neck becoming loose like warm rubber. Your head feeling balanced and supported.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The wave of relaxation flows into your shoulders. Shoulders are where we carry so much of life's burden. Feel yours dropping now. Releasing their load. Becoming soft and heavy.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Down through your arms. The relaxation flowing like warm honey through your upper arms... your elbows... your forearms. Into your wrists and hands. Each finger becoming loose and heavy.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Your chest now. Feel your breathing becoming even slower, even deeper. Your heart beating calmly, steadily. A sense of openness filling your entire chest cavity. Your heart available to your family.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The warmth spreads through your stomach. Any knots or butterflies dissolving completely. Your stomach becoming soft and relaxed. All emotional guardedness releasing.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Into your lower back—that area that works so hard. Feel it softening. The muscles along your spine releasing their grip. Your entire back sinking into whatever supports you.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Through your hips now, releasing any tightness held there. Down into your thighs. Your large leg muscles becoming completely limp, loose, and heavy. Like lead weights.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Past your knees, into your calves. These muscles that carry you through each day—resting now. Completely at peace.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Into your ankles, your feet, your toes. Every muscle, every joint, every cell of your body now bathed in deep relaxation. The golden light of emotional openness has filled you completely.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

You are deeply relaxed, Austin. Your body is at peace. Your mind is calm and receptive. With each breath, you go deeper. The better you feel, the deeper you go. The deeper you go, the more emotionally available you become.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== DEEPENING - 20-Step Staircase (8-10 minutes) ===

In your mind's eye, you find yourself at the top of a beautiful staircase. This staircase has twenty steps, and it leads down to a place of full emotional openness—a sanctuary where your heart is completely available to your family.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The banister is smooth beneath your hand. The steps are solid and safe. With each step you descend, you will go twice as deep into hypnosis, and your emotional availability will double.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Step twenty. Taking the first step down. Feeling relaxation deepen. Heart beginning to open.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step nineteen. Going deeper. Emotional walls lowering.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step three. The sanctuary is just ahead.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step two. One more step.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step one. You step off the staircase into the sanctuary of emotional openness. You are in the deepest state of hypnosis. Here, your heart is completely available. Everything you hear will be absorbed completely by your subconscious mind.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== THERAPEUTIC CONTENT (15-18 minutes) ===

--- Understanding Emotional Availability ---

Austin, emotional availability means being open to your family's feelings—the good and the difficult. It means they can come to you with anything and find a safe place.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When a child is upset, they do not always need solutions. They need to feel heard. They need someone to acknowledge their experience. "I see you are upset. Tell me about it." These simple words validate their reality.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When a spouse shares a frustration, the instinct may be to fix it. To offer solutions. To solve the problem. But often, they just need you to listen. To understand. To care. Solutions can wait until after they feel heard.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Emotional availability is not about having all the answers. It is about being present to whatever emotion arises. It is about creating space for feelings to be expressed and received.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Barriers to Emotional Availability ---

Some of us were raised to hide emotions. To be strong meant to be stoic. To show feelings was weakness. These messages run deep and can make emotional availability feel foreign or unsafe.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

But strength in a family includes vulnerability. True connection requires emotional honesty. A father who is emotionally available is stronger, not weaker, than one who is closed off.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Other barriers include busyness—being too rushed to tune into feelings. Or discomfort—not knowing what to do with big emotions. Or fear—worrying that opening up will lead to overwhelming demands.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

These barriers can be gently lowered. Awareness is the first step. You are becoming aware now, and that awareness creates space for change.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- The Scripture's Invitation ---

The scripture says, "Mourn with those that mourn, and comfort those that stand in need of comfort." This is emotional availability in action—entering another's experience with them.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Jesus wept at the tomb of Lazarus. He did not stand aloof from grief. He entered it. He felt it. This is the model of emotional presence—to feel with those we love.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your family needs you to be capable of feeling with them. Not fixing, not dismissing, not minimizing—but feeling. This is profound gift.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Responding to Emotions Without Changing Them ---

One key skill is responding to emotions without trying to change them. Instead of "don't be sad" or "there's nothing to worry about," try "I see you are sad. I am here with you." Presence, not correction.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When you try to change someone's emotion, they often feel unheard. Their experience has been dismissed. But when you simply acknowledge and accompany, they feel validated. They feel loved.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This does not mean you cannot help eventually. It means help comes after presence. First, feel with them. Then, if they want solutions, offer them.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Being Open About Your Own Feelings ---

Emotional availability also means being open about your own feelings. Not burdening your family inappropriately, but being genuine. "I feel tired today." "I am proud of you." "I love our family."

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When children see their father express emotions appropriately, they learn that emotions are normal and manageable. They learn emotional vocabulary. They learn that strength includes feeling.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When your spouse sees your emotional openness, intimacy deepens. Walls come down. Love can flow more freely between open hearts.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Noticing When You Close Down ---

Notice when you close down emotionally. When do you pull away? When do walls go up? What triggers emotional shutdown?

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Often, we close when we feel helpless—when an emotion seems too big to handle. We close when we are overwhelmed—when our own emotions are already full. We close when triggered—when something touches our own unresolved pain.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Recognizing these moments allows a different choice. You can notice the impulse to close and choose to stay open. Not always perfectly, but increasingly. This is growth.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Visualizing Emotional Availability ---

Let us visualize emotional availability now. Imagine one of your children coming to you upset. Perhaps they had a hard day. Perhaps something hurt their feelings.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

See yourself stopping what you are doing. Really stopping. Turning toward them with your full attention.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You get down to their level. You look at them with soft eyes. You say, "I see you are upset. Tell me about it."

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You listen without interrupting. Without judging. Without rushing to fix. You are simply present with their feeling.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Perhaps you place a hand on their shoulder. Perhaps you pull them into a hug. You feel with them. Their sadness touches your heart.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Watch how they respond. They feel heard. They feel safe. They may cry, and that is okay. You are holding space for their emotion.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

After the emotion passes, you might ask, "What do you need?" Maybe they need help solving a problem. Maybe they just needed to be heard. Either way, the connection has deepened.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Anchor Reinforcement ---

Place your hand over your heart now.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

This anchor now carries the capacity for emotional availability. When you use this anchor, your heart opens. Your walls lower. You become emotionally accessible to your family.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Use this anchor when you sense a family member needs emotional presence. Feel your heart soften. Become available.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Release your hand. The anchor is strengthened.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Creating Emotional Safety ---

Emotional availability creates safety. Your family learns they can come to you. They learn that feelings are welcome in your home. They learn that emotions will be met with understanding, not judgment.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This is a profound gift. Many children grow up in homes where emotions are dangerous—where feelings are punished or ignored. You are creating something different. Something healing.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your spouse will also thrive in emotional safety. They can share their heart without fear. Intimacy deepens when both partners are emotionally available.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Sealing the Commitment ---

From now on, you will practice emotional availability. When family members share feelings, you will remain open. You will listen. You will validate. You will be present.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You will also share appropriately. Let your family see that you have feelings too. Model emotional health. Show that feelings are normal and manageable.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This does not mean you will always be perfectly available. You are human. But when you notice you have closed down, you will gently reopen. Return is always possible.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== POST-HYPNOTIC SUGGESTIONS (2-3 minutes) ===

Your subconscious now holds the gift of emotional availability. Your heart knows how to be open. Your family can reach you.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

From now on, you will naturally sense when family members need emotional presence. You will stop, turn toward them, and give them access to your heart.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When emotions arise—theirs or yours—you will welcome them. You will not minimize or rush. You will hold space for feelings to be expressed and received.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your hand-over-heart anchor will activate emotional availability instantly. When you use it, your heart will soften and open.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your family will feel the safety you create. Love will deepen. Connection will grow. Your home will become a place where emotions are welcome.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== EMERGENCE (3-5 minutes) ===

It is time to return to full awareness, carrying your commitment to emotional availability with you.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

In a moment, I will count from one to ten. With each number, you will become more alert, more awake, while your capacity for emotional availability remains permanently installed.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One. Beginning the journey back. Emotional availability sealed within you.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Two. Feeling energy returning to your body. Heart open.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Three. Your mind clearing. Emotionally accessible.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Four. More alert now. Ready to feel with your family.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Five. Halfway back. Feeling wonderful.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Six. More alert with each breath. Heart soft.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Seven. Almost there. Emotional safety radiating.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Eight. Eyes preparing to open. Love flowing.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Nine. Nearly fully awake. Taking a deep, refreshing breath.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Ten. Eyes open, fully alert, completely refreshed, and emotionally available.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Welcome back, Austin. You have opened your heart to your family in a new way.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Remember: emotional availability is presence at the deepest level. Your family needs access to your heart. Now they have it.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Go create emotional safety for those you love. They deserve a place where feelings are welcome. You are now equipped to give them that gift.
