Another breath, deeper... letting go of distractions... hold... and release.

One more breath... eyes closing, heart opening to your family.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let the golden light of presence warm you. Head to toe. Distractions fading. Your family coming into focus.

Descend now. Ten to one. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Complete presence.

Your family needs your presence more than almost anything. Not just physical presence—your full attention, your engaged heart.

Spouses need presence too. Presence says: You still matter. You are still my priority.

The Savior was fully present with whoever was before Him. You can learn this presence. It is a skill you can develop.

Your family is precious. Your time with them is finite. Presence honors both truths.
