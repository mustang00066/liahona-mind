=== PRE-TALK / SETTLING (1-2 minutes) ===

Welcome, Austin. You have come seeking to be more present with your family. This is one of the most precious gifts you can give them—and yourself.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

In our distracted world, true presence has become rare. We are often physically near our loved ones while our minds are elsewhere. Today we begin changing that.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This is not about adding more to your schedule. It is about transforming the quality of the time you already spend. Let us begin.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== INDUCTION - Rapid Relaxation with Breathing (5-6 minutes) ===

Take a deep breath now. Diaphragmatic breathing—belly expanding as you breathe in, sinking as you breathe out.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Breathe in through your nose... belly rising gently... hold for a moment... and release through your mouth. With this exhale, feel your family coming into focus.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Another breath... deeper... and as you exhale, allow your eyes to close naturally.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let a golden light begin at the top of your head. This light is the light of presence. It warms your scalp. Relaxes your forehead. Softens the muscles around your eyes.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your eyelids becoming wonderfully heavy. As though gently stuck together.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The golden light flows down. Neck becoming loose like rubber bands. Shoulders dropping—releasing all tension.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Arms becoming limp, loose, and heavy. All the way down to your hands.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Through your chest, your heart expanding with love. Through your stomach, all tension dissolving.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Through your legs, becoming heavy like lead. Down to your feet. Your whole body relaxed.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The better you feel, the deeper you go. The deeper you go, the more your capacity for presence expands.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== DEEPENING (3-4 minutes) ===

Imagine yourself at the top of a staircase... ten steps leading down to a sanctuary of pure presence.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Ten. Stepping down. Presence beginning to awaken.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Nine. Deeper. Heart opening toward your family.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Eight. Distractions falling away.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Seven. Deeper still.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Six. Halfway there.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Five. So deep. So peaceful.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Four. Almost there.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Three. Love for your family expanding.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Two. One more step.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

One. You step into the sanctuary of presence. Everything you hear will be absorbed completely.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== THERAPEUTIC CONTENT (8-10 minutes) ===

--- The Gift of Presence ---

Austin, your family needs your presence more than almost anything else you can give them. Not just your physical presence—your full attention, your emotional availability, your engaged heart.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Children spell love T-I-M-E. But not just any time—present time. When you are with them but distracted, they notice. Something is missing. They know when they do not have all of you.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When you are truly present, everything changes. They bloom under the warmth of your undivided attention.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Your spouse needs presence too. The relationship that began with rapt attention can wither under divided focus. But every moment of full attention says: You still matter. I choose you.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- The Savior as Model ---

The Savior was the perfect model of presence. He said, "Suffer little children to come unto me." And when they came, He gave each child His full attention. He saw them.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When the woman touched His garment in a pressing crowd, He stopped. He found her. In that moment, she had all of Him.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This is the presence you are learning. The commitment to be fully there with whoever is before you.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Presence is a Skill ---

Here is good news: presence is not a personality trait you lack. It is a skill you can develop. A habit you can build.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Every time you choose presence over distraction, the neural pathways of attention strengthen. You are training your brain for presence. It becomes easier over time.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Installing the Anchor ---

Let us install an anchor for presence. Place your hand gently over your heart.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Feel the warmth of your hand. Feel your heartbeat. This is your presence anchor.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Whenever you place your hand over your heart and take a slow breath, your capacity for presence will activate. Use it when you come home. Use it when your child wants your attention. Use it when your spouse needs you.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Hand over heart. Slow breath. Presence activated.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Release your hand. The anchor is installed.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Practicing Presence ---

Bring to mind a family member. See their face clearly.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Feel your love for this person. Let it rise in your chest.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Now imagine being with them with full attention. Looking at them when they speak. Listening completely. Your phone nowhere in sight. Just you and them.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Feel how different this is from partial presence. The connection is deeper. They feel seen. They feel valued.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- What Presence Requires ---

Presence requires setting aside distractions. Devices, work thoughts, worries—these can wait. Your family cannot always wait. Time passes. Children grow. Moments slip away.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

No other success can compensate for failure in the home. Presence is how you succeed at home.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

In sessions ahead, you will learn to put away distractions, give quality time, be emotionally available, and create lasting memories. Today, the foundation is laid.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Sealing the Commitment ---

Your family is precious. Your time with them is finite. Presence honors both truths.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Every moment of presence says: You matter to me. I choose you.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

These words, spoken through presence, create security in your children, nurture love with your spouse, and form bonds that last forever.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== POST-HYPNOTIC SUGGESTIONS (1 minute) ===

Your subconscious now holds the gift of presence. It knows your attention is your most precious gift.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

From now on, you will choose presence with your family. Your anchor will activate instantly. Distractions will wait.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

When your attention wanders, you will gently return. Presence is your practice now.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== EMERGENCE (2-3 minutes) ===

It is time to return to full awareness, carrying your commitment to presence.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

I will count from one to five. With each number, you become more alert while presence remains sealed.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

One. Beginning to return. Presence installed.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Two. Energy returning. Love for your family strong.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Three. More alert. Ready to be present.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Four. Almost fully awake. Heart full.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Five. Eyes open, fully awake, completely alert, and ready for your family.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Welcome back, Austin. You have begun an important journey—learning to truly be with your family.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Remember your anchor: hand over heart, slow breath, presence activated.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Your family is waiting for your presence. It is the greatest gift. Go give it freely.
