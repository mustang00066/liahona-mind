=== PRE-TALK / SETTLING (1-2 minutes) ===

Welcome back, Austin. This is your final session on family presence. Today we integrate everything you have learned. You are ready to live as a present father, husband, and family member.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Over five sessions, you have built a complete practice of presence. Today we seal this transformation. Presence will become your natural way of being with your family.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This is not an ending—it is a graduation. You have done the work. Now you step into the life of a fully present family man. Let us complete your transformation.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== INDUCTION - Rapid Relaxation with Breathing (5-6 minutes) ===

Take a deep breath now. Diaphragmatic breathing—belly expanding as you breathe in, sinking as you breathe out.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Breathe in through your nose... belly rising gently... hold for a moment... and release through your mouth. With this exhale, feel the integration beginning.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Another breath... deeper... and as you exhale, allow your eyes to close naturally.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let a golden light begin at the top of your head. This light is familiar now. It warms your scalp. Relaxes your forehead. Softens the muscles around your eyes.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your eyelids becoming wonderfully heavy. As though gently stuck together.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The golden light flows down. Neck becoming loose like rubber bands. Shoulders dropping—releasing all tension.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Arms becoming limp, loose, and heavy. All the way down to your hands.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Through your chest, love for your family expanding. Through your stomach, all tension dissolving.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Through your legs, becoming heavy like lead. Down to your feet. Your whole body relaxed.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The better you feel, the deeper you go. The deeper you go, the more completely your presence integrates.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Austin, honor how far you have come. You are not the same person who began this journey. Your capacity for presence has expanded. Your habits have shifted.
