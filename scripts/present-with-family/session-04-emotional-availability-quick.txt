=== PRE-TALK / SETTLING (1-2 minutes) ===

Welcome back, Austin. Today we focus on emotional availability—being present not just physically, but emotionally. Your family needs access to your heart.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Being emotionally available means your family can reach you. They can share their feelings and be received. They can come with joy or pain, and you will truly be there with them.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This is the deepest form of presence. It requires vulnerability, but the connection it creates is profound. Let us begin.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== INDUCTION - Rapid Relaxation with Breathing (5-6 minutes) ===

Take a deep breath now. Diaphragmatic breathing—belly expanding as you breathe in, sinking as you breathe out.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Breathe in through your nose... belly rising gently... hold for a moment... and release through your mouth. With this exhale, feel your heart beginning to soften.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Another breath... deeper... and as you exhale, allow your eyes to close naturally.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let a golden light begin at the top of your head. This light is the light of emotional openness. It warms your scalp. Relaxes your forehead. Softens the muscles around your eyes.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your eyelids becoming wonderfully heavy. As though gently stuck together.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The golden light flows down. Neck becoming loose like rubber bands. Shoulders dropping—releasing all tension.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Arms becoming limp, loose, and heavy. All the way down to your hands.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Through your chest, your heart opening. Through your stomach, all emotional guardedness dissolving.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Through your legs, becoming heavy like lead. Down to your feet. Your whole body relaxed.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The better you feel, the deeper you go. The deeper you go, the more emotionally available you become.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== DEEPENING (3-4 minutes) ===

Imagine yourself at the top of a staircase... ten steps leading down to a sanctuary of emotional openness.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Ten. Stepping down. Heart beginning to open.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Two. One more step.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

One. You step into the sanctuary of emotional openness. Everything you hear will be absorbed completely.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== THERAPEUTIC CONTENT (8-10 minutes) ===

Receive only what serves you. Your subconscious mind will accept what is true for you and let the rest go.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

--- Understanding Emotional Availability ---

Austin, emotional availability means being open to your family's feelings—the good and the difficult. Not fixing, not dismissing—being present with them.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When a child is upset, they need to feel heard. "I see you are upset. Tell me about it." These words validate their experience.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When a spouse shares frustration, they often need you to listen, not fix. Understanding first. Solutions later.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Barriers to Openness ---

Some of us were raised to hide emotions. To be strong meant to be stoic. But strength in a family includes vulnerability. Connection requires emotional honesty.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Other barriers include busyness, discomfort with big emotions, or fear. These barriers can be gently lowered. Awareness is the first step.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- The Scripture's Invitation ---

The scripture says, "Mourn with those that mourn." This is emotional availability—entering another's experience with them.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Jesus wept at Lazarus's tomb. He entered the grief. He felt it. This is the model—to feel with those we love.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Responding to Emotions ---

Respond to emotions without trying to change them. Instead of "don't be sad," try "I see you are sad. I am here." Presence, not correction.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When you try to change someone's emotion, they feel unheard. When you acknowledge and accompany, they feel loved.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Sharing Your Own Feelings ---

Be open about your own feelings too. "I feel tired today." "I am proud of you." This models emotional health for your children.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When your spouse sees your openness, intimacy deepens. Walls come down. Love flows between open hearts.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Noticing When You Close ---

Notice when you close down emotionally. When do walls go up? Recognizing these moments allows a different choice—to stay open.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You can notice the impulse to close and choose to stay present. This is growth.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Visualizing Emotional Availability ---

Imagine your child coming to you upset. See yourself stopping. Turning toward them with full attention.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You say, "I see you are upset. Tell me about it." You listen without rushing to fix. You feel with them.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Watch how they respond. They feel heard. They feel safe. The connection deepens.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Anchor Reinforcement ---

Place your hand over your heart now.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

This anchor now carries emotional availability. When you use it, your heart opens. You become emotionally accessible.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Use this anchor when a family member needs emotional presence.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Release your hand. The anchor is strengthened.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Sealing the Commitment ---

Emotional availability creates safety. Your family learns they can come to you. Feelings are welcome in your home.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

From now on, when family members share feelings, you will remain open. You will listen. You will be present.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You will also share appropriately. Model emotional health. Show that feelings are normal.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== POST-HYPNOTIC SUGGESTIONS (1 minute) ===

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== EMERGENCE (2-3 minutes) ===

It is time to return to full awareness, carrying your commitment to emotional availability.
