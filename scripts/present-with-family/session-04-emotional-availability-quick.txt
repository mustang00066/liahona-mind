[BEGIN SCRIPT]

Welcome back, Austin. Today we focus on emotional availability. Your family needs you emotionally present—open, responsive, connected.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Take a deep breath in... hold... and release, opening your emotional self.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Another breath, deeper... letting down walls... hold... and release.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One more breath... eyes closing, heart becoming available.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let the golden light of emotional presence open your heart. Head to toe. Defenses softening. Capacity for connection growing.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Descend now. Ten to one. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Complete availability.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Emotional availability means being open to your family's feelings. Not fixing, not dismissing—being present with them.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When a child is upset, they need to feel heard. I see you are upset. Tell me about it. This validates their experience.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When a spouse shares frustration, they often just need you to listen, not to fix.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Be open about your own feelings too. Connection requires emotional honesty.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The scripture says, Mourn with those that mourn. This is emotional availability—entering another's experience.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Respond to emotions without changing them. Instead of do not be sad, try I see you are sad. I am here.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Notice when you close down. When do walls go up? Awareness allows a different choice.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When family members share feelings, remain open. Listen. Validate. Be present. Share your own feelings appropriately.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One... beginning to return.
Two... feeling open and present.
Three... becoming alert.
Four... refreshed and available.
Five... eyes open, fully alert. Be emotionally available, Austin. Your family needs your heart.
