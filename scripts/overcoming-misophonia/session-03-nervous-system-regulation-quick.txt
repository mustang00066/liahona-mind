=== PRE-TALK / SETTLING (1-2 minutes) ===

Welcome back, Austin. You have learned about your triggers and the pause. Today we address the core of your reaction: your nervous system.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

When triggered, your nervous system activates fight-or-flight automatically. Today you learn to regulate it—to calm the response and build baseline calm.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let us train your body to return to peace.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== INDUCTION - Rapid Relaxation with Breathing (5-6 minutes) ===

Take a deep breath now. Diaphragmatic breathing—belly expanding as you breathe in, sinking as you breathe out.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Breathe in through your nose... belly rising gently... hold for a moment... and release. Your nervous system is settling.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Another breath... deeper... and as you exhale, allow your eyes to close naturally.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let your neck become loose like rubber bands. Head floating. Jaws sagging. Shoulders dropping.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Arms becoming limp, loose, and heavy. All the way down to your hands.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Legs and feet the same. The better you feel, the deeper you go. Regulation developing.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Your eyelids becoming wonderfully heavy. As though gently stuck together. Ready to train your nervous system.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== DEEPENING (3-4 minutes) ===

Imagine yourself at the top of a staircase... ten steps leading down to deep nervous system calm.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Ten. Stepping down. Nervous system calming.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Nine. Deeper. Stress dissolving.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Eight. Body settling.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Seven. Deeper still.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Six. Halfway there.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Five. So calm. So regulated.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Four. Almost there.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Three. Deep peace.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Two. One more step.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

One. You enter a place of deep nervous system calm. Here your body learns to return to peace quickly. Everything you experience will train your nervous system.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== THERAPEUTIC CONTENT (8-10 minutes) ===

Receive only what serves you. Your subconscious mind will accept what is true for you and let the rest go.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

--- Your Nervous System ---

Your autonomic nervous system has two branches: sympathetic for fight-or-flight, parasympathetic for rest and calm.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

In misophonia, your sympathetic system overreacts to triggers. The goal is to calm it when activated and strengthen your parasympathetic as your default state.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- The Vagus Nerve ---

The key is your vagus nerve—the main nerve of calm. When activated, it slows your heart, relaxes muscles, and signals safety.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You will learn to activate it.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Extended Exhale Breathing ---

Make your exhale longer than your inhale. This activates the vagus nerve.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Practice now. Breathe in for four... one... two... three... four.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Exhale for six... one... two... three... four... five... six.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Again. Inhale for four... exhale for six.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Physiological Sigh ---

The fastest way to calm: full inhale, second short sniff, long exhale.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Practice now. Full inhale... second sniff... long exhale.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This rapidly calms your nervous system.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Building Baseline Calm ---

Daily practice builds your calm reserve. When your baseline is calm, triggers are less intense.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Practice extended exhale breathing daily. Use the physiological sigh when triggered. Your body learns to return to calm faster.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Anchor Reinforcement ---

Press thumb into palm now, reinforcing your anchor.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

This anchor now carries nervous system regulation. Combined with breath, it interrupts the stress response.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Say internally: "I can regulate my nervous system. My body knows how to return to calm."

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Release your thumb.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== POST-HYPNOTIC SUGGESTIONS (1 minute) ===

You will use extended exhale breathing daily. This builds baseline calm.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

When triggered, you will use the physiological sigh. Your body knows how to calm down.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your anchor activates regulation. Your threshold is rising.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== EMERGENCE (2-3 minutes) ===

It is time to return to full awareness, bringing regulation with you.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

I will count from one to five. With each number, you become more alert while your nervous system remains calm.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

One. Beginning to return. Regulation trained.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Two. Energy returning. Calm inside.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Three. Baseline calm strengthened.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Four. Almost fully alert. Grounded.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Five. Eyes open, fully awake, completely alert, and nervous system regulated.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Welcome back, Austin. Extended exhale breathing daily. Physiological sigh when triggered. Your body is learning to regulate.
