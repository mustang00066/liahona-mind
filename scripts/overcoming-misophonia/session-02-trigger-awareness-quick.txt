=== PRE-TALK / SETTLING (1-2 minutes) ===

Welcome back, Austin. In your first session, you learned what misophonia is. Today we go deeper into awareness.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Before you can change a reaction, you must understand it. Today you will map your triggers, recognize early warning signs, and learn to pause before escalation.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let us develop the awareness that creates choice.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== INDUCTION - Rapid Relaxation with Breathing (5-6 minutes) ===

Take a deep breath now. Diaphragmatic breathing—belly expanding as you breathe in, sinking as you breathe out.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Breathe in through your nose... belly rising gently... hold for a moment... and release. With this exhale, release any past trigger reactions.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Another breath... deeper... and as you exhale, allow your eyes to close naturally.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let your neck become loose like rubber bands. Head floating. Jaws sagging. Shoulders dropping.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Arms becoming limp, loose, and heavy. All the way down to your hands.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Legs and feet the same. The better you feel, the deeper you go. Awareness growing.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Your eyelids becoming wonderfully heavy. As though gently stuck together. Ready to observe clearly.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== DEEPENING (3-4 minutes) ===

Imagine yourself at the top of a staircase... ten steps leading down to a place of clear awareness.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Ten. Stepping down. Awareness growing.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Nine. Deeper. Clarity developing.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Eight. Ready to observe.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Seven. Deeper still.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Six. Halfway there.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Five. So deep. So aware.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Four. Almost there.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Three. Deep clarity.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Two. One more step.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

One. You enter a place of profound awareness. Here you can observe your triggers clearly and calmly. Everything you discover will support your healing.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== THERAPEUTIC CONTENT (8-10 minutes) ===

Receive only what serves you. Your subconscious mind will accept what is true for you and let the rest go.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

--- Mapping Your Triggers ---

In this place of awareness, you can examine your triggers without being overwhelmed.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Common categories include: mouth sounds like chewing and slurping... breathing sounds like sniffing and sighing... throat sounds... vocal patterns... mechanical sounds like clicking and tapping.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Notice which affect you most. Notice if certain people trigger you more than others. This understanding removes blame and increases awareness.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- The Anatomy of a Reaction ---

When triggered, a sequence unfolds: the sound occurs... your brain recognizes it as a trigger... your body activates fight-or-flight... emotions flood you... thoughts spiral... behavior follows.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This happens fast. But there ARE gaps between stages—brief windows where intervention is possible.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Early Warning Signs ---

Your body gives signals before full escalation: jaw tightening, shoulders rising, stomach clenching, breath becoming shallow.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Catch these early signs. The earlier you catch the reaction, the more options you have.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- The Pause ---

Between stimulus and response, there is space. In that space lies your power. This is the pause.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When you notice early warning signs: First, notice. "I am being triggered." Second, breathe. One slow, deep breath. Third, anchor. Press thumb into palm.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This pause takes ten seconds. But it can prevent full escalation.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Practicing the Pause ---

Imagine a situation where a trigger might occur. See yourself there.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Imagine a mild trigger sound. Immediately, you notice. "I am being triggered."

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

You breathe. Take a slow breath now. Belly expanding... release.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You anchor. Press thumb into palm now. Feel the calm.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Release your thumb.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Anchor Reinforcement ---

Press thumb into palm again, reinforcing your anchor.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

This anchor carries your pause practice. When triggered, you access choice.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Say internally: "I notice early. I pause. I breathe. I anchor. I choose."

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Release your thumb.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== POST-HYPNOTIC SUGGESTIONS (1 minute) ===

You will notice triggers with curiosity, not just distress. You will catch early warning signs earlier and earlier.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

You will pause. Notice. Breathe. Anchor. This creates choice.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Awareness is growing. Control is developing.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== EMERGENCE (2-3 minutes) ===

It is time to return to full awareness, bringing enhanced awareness with you.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

I will count from one to five. With each number, you become more alert while awareness sharpens.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

One. Beginning to return. Awareness enhanced.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Two. Energy returning. The pause installed.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Three. Catching triggers early.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Four. Almost fully alert. Prepared.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Five. Eyes open, fully awake, completely alert, and deeply aware.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Welcome back, Austin. Notice early. Pause. Breathe. Anchor. Practice daily. Your capacity to choose is growing.
