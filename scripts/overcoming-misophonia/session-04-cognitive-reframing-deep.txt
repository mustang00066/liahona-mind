=== PRE-TALK / SETTLING (2-3 minutes) ===

Welcome back, Austin. You have learned to understand your misophonia, recognize triggers early, pause, and regulate your nervous system. Today we work with your mind—specifically, how you think about trigger sounds.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your thoughts about a trigger sound influence how intensely you react to it. Thoughts like "I can't stand this" or "This is unbearable" amplify your distress. But these thoughts can be changed.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Today you will learn cognitive reframing—the ability to change your relationship with trigger sounds by changing how you think about them. This is not about pretending they do not bother you. It is about finding more accurate, more helpful thoughts.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Find a comfortable position. Let us reshape your thinking about sound.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== INDUCTION - Eye Fatigue with Diaphragmatic Breathing (10-12 minutes) ===

Begin by finding a spot on the ceiling or wall, slightly above your natural line of sight. A spot that requires you to look upward without straining your neck.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Focus on that spot. Keep your eyes fixed there as you begin to breathe deeply. Diaphragmatic breathing—belly expanding as you breathe in, sinking as you breathe out.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Breathe in through your nose... belly rising gently... hold for a moment... and release through your mouth. With this exhale, release old thoughts about sounds.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Continue gazing at that spot. Notice how your eyes begin to feel. A slight strain. A heaviness developing. This is natural and welcome.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Another breath now... deeper than before... belly expanding... hold... and release. Your mind is open to new perspectives.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Keep your eyes on that spot. They are growing heavier. The muscles around your eyes are tiring.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Breathe in once more... letting the breath fill your entire chest cavity... hold... and as you exhale, notice your eyes wanting to close. When the desire becomes strong enough, allow them to close naturally.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

If your eyes have not yet closed, take another breath and let them close with the exhale.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Eyes now closed... feel the relief. In this peaceful state, you can examine and reshape your thoughts about sound.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Now that your eyes are closed, bring your attention to your breathing. Allow each breath to deepen the relaxation flowing through your body.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

With your next breath, focus on your scalp. Feel it softening, relaxing.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

This warmth flows down to your forehead. Feel the muscles of your forehead smoothing out.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Down to your eyes now—those tired muscles resting deeply. Your eyelids becoming wonderfully heavy.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The relaxation spreads to your cheeks and jaw. Your jaw becoming slack.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Down into your neck. Feel each vertebra of your neck relaxing.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The wave of relaxation flows into your shoulders. Feel yours dropping now.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Down through your arms. The relaxation flowing through your upper arms... your elbows... your forearms. Into your wrists and hands.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Your chest now. Feel your breathing becoming even slower, even deeper.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The warmth spreads through your stomach.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Into your lower back. Feel it softening.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Through your hips now. Down into your thighs. Completely limp, loose, and heavy.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Past your knees, into your calves. Resting now.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Into your ankles, your feet, your toes. Every muscle, every cell bathed in deep relaxation.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

You are deeply relaxed, Austin. Your body is at peace. Your mind is open. Ready to reshape your thinking.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== DEEPENING - 20-Step Staircase (8-10 minutes) ===

In your mind's eye, you find yourself at the top of a beautiful staircase. This staircase has twenty steps, and it leads down to a place of cognitive flexibility—where you can see sounds differently.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The banister is smooth beneath your hand. With each step you descend, you will go deeper into hypnosis and closer to new ways of thinking about sound.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step two. One more step.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step one. You step into a place of cognitive flexibility. Here, you can examine your thoughts about sound and reshape them. Everything you hear will be absorbed completely.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== THERAPEUTIC CONTENT (15-18 minutes) ===

--- Thoughts Amplify Reactions ---

In this place of flexibility, let us understand how thoughts affect your reactions.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When a trigger sound occurs, it is not just the sound that causes distress. It is what you think about the sound.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Thoughts like "I can't stand this," "This is unbearable," "They're doing this on purpose," or "I have to escape" pour gasoline on the fire of your reaction.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

These thoughts feel true in the moment. But they are not facts—they are interpretations. And interpretations can be changed.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Common Unhelpful Thoughts ---

Let us examine common unhelpful thoughts that accompany misophonia.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Catastrophizing: "I can't stand this." "I'm going to lose it." "This is unbearable."

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Attribution: "They're doing this on purpose." "They don't care about me." "They should know better."

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Helplessness: "There's nothing I can do." "I'm trapped." "This will never get better."

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Overgeneralization: "Everyone makes these sounds." "I can never eat with people." "My life is ruined by sounds."

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

These thoughts feel automatic and true. But notice: they are interpretations, not facts. And they make your reaction worse.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Challenging the Thoughts ---

The first step in reframing is to question your thoughts.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When you think "I can't stand this," ask: Is that literally true? Have you stood it before? Are you standing it right now? You are still here, still functioning. "I can't stand it" is not accurate.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When you think "They're doing this on purpose," ask: Is that really true? Are they making sounds AT you, or just making sounds? Most people are not even aware of the sounds they make.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When you think "This is unbearable," ask: What would be truly unbearable? Severe injury? Loss of a loved one? This sound is uncomfortable, not unbearable. There is a difference.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Questioning your thoughts does not make trigger sounds pleasant. It makes them more manageable by reducing the cognitive fuel that intensifies your reaction.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Reframing Statements ---

Now let us install more accurate, more helpful thoughts.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Instead of "I can't stand this," try: "This is uncomfortable, but I can handle it." This is more accurate. You have handled it before. You are handling it now.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Instead of "They're doing this on purpose," try: "This is just a sound they make. It's not about me." This removes the personal offense and reduces anger.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Instead of "I have to escape," try: "I can stay and use my tools. I have options." This restores agency and reduces panic.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Instead of "This will never get better," try: "My brain is rewiring. Each time I cope, I get stronger." This is hopeful and true.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- The Observer Perspective ---

Another powerful reframe is to observe your reaction rather than being consumed by it.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Instead of "I am angry," try: "I notice anger arising." Instead of "I am triggered," try: "A trigger reaction is happening."

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This subtle shift—from being the reaction to observing the reaction—creates distance. You are not the anger. You are the one noticing the anger.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

From this observer position, you have more choice. You can watch the reaction rise and fall without being swept away by it.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Compassion for the Sound-Maker ---

Sometimes reframing involves developing compassion for the person making the sound.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The person chewing is just eating. The person sniffing may be dealing with allergies or a cold. The person breathing loudly may have a respiratory condition.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

They are not attacking you. They are just existing. And their existence involves sounds, as does yours.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When you can see them as a person—with their own struggles, their own unawareness of their sounds—you move from anger toward understanding. This reduces your reaction.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Your Core Reframe ---

Let us install a core reframe that you can use in any trigger situation.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Repeat internally: "This is a sound. Sounds cannot harm me. I am uncomfortable but safe. I can handle this."

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Again: "This is a sound. Sounds cannot harm me. I am uncomfortable but safe. I can handle this."

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

This statement is true. Sounds, no matter how irritating, cannot physically harm you. Your discomfort is real, but you are safe. You can handle it, as you have handled it before.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Anchor Reinforcement ---

Press your thumb into your palm now, reinforcing your calm anchor.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This anchor now carries cognitive reframing. When you use it, you access the perspective that sounds cannot harm you, that you are uncomfortable but safe, that you can handle this.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Say internally: "I choose my thoughts about sounds. I can reframe any trigger. I am in control of my mind."

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

This anchor is growing stronger.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Release your thumb.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== POST-HYPNOTIC SUGGESTIONS (2-3 minutes) ===

Let this cognitive flexibility sink deep into your subconscious mind now.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When triggered, you will notice your thoughts. You will recognize when thoughts like "I can't stand this" are amplifying your distress.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You will question unhelpful thoughts. Is it true? Is it helpful? Is there another way to see this?

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You will reframe with accuracy. "This is uncomfortable, but I can handle it. Sounds cannot harm me. I am safe."

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You will observe your reactions rather than being consumed by them. "I notice anger arising. A trigger reaction is happening."

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your thoughts about sounds are changing. Your reactions are softening.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== EMERGENCE (3-5 minutes) ===

It is time to return to full waking consciousness, bringing cognitive flexibility with you.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

In a moment, I will count from one to ten. With each number, you will become more alert, more awake, while your new thinking patterns strengthen.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One. Beginning the journey back. New thoughts installed.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Two. Feeling energy returning to your body. Flexible now.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Three. Unhelpful thoughts weakening.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Four. Your mind clearing. Reframes available.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Five. Halfway back now. Feeling empowered.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Six. More alert with each breath. Observer perspective available.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Seven. Almost there. Thoughts under control.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Eight. Eyes preparing to open. Grounded.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Nine. Nearly fully awake. Taking a deep, refreshing breath.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Ten. Eyes open, fully alert, completely refreshed, and cognitively flexible.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Welcome back, Austin. Your thinking about sounds is changing.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Remember: thoughts amplify or diminish reactions. When triggered, notice your thoughts, question them, reframe them. "Sounds cannot harm me. I am uncomfortable but safe. I can handle this."
