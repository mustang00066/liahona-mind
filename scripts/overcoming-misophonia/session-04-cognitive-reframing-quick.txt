=== PRE-TALK / SETTLING (1-2 minutes) ===

Welcome back, Austin. You have learned about your triggers, the pause, and nervous system regulation. Today we work with your mind.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Your thoughts about trigger sounds influence how intensely you react. Thoughts like "I can't stand this" amplify distress. But thoughts can be changed.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let us reshape your thinking about sound.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== INDUCTION - Rapid Relaxation with Breathing (5-6 minutes) ===

Take a deep breath now. Diaphragmatic breathing—belly expanding as you breathe in, sinking as you breathe out.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Breathe in through your nose... belly rising gently... hold for a moment... and release. Old thoughts about sounds releasing.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Another breath... deeper... and as you exhale, allow your eyes to close naturally.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let your neck become loose like rubber bands. Head floating. Jaws sagging. Shoulders dropping.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Arms becoming limp, loose, and heavy. All the way down to your hands.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Legs and feet the same. The better you feel, the deeper you go. Mind opening.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Your eyelids becoming wonderfully heavy. As though gently stuck together. Ready for new perspectives.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== DEEPENING (3-4 minutes) ===

Imagine yourself at the top of a staircase... ten steps leading down to a place of cognitive flexibility.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Ten. Stepping down. Mind opening.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Nine. Deeper. Old thoughts loosening.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Eight. New perspectives available.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Seven. Deeper still.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Six. Halfway there.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Five. So open. So flexible.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Four. Almost there.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Three. Deep receptivity.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Two. One more step.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

One. You enter a place of cognitive flexibility. Here you can reshape your thoughts about sound. Everything you hear will be absorbed completely.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== THERAPEUTIC CONTENT (8-10 minutes) ===

Receive only what serves you. Your subconscious mind will accept what is true for you and let the rest go.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

--- Thoughts Amplify Reactions ---

When triggered, it is not just the sound causing distress. It is what you think about the sound.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Thoughts like "I can't stand this" or "They're doing this on purpose" pour gasoline on your reaction. But these are interpretations, not facts. And they can change.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Common Unhelpful Thoughts ---

Notice unhelpful patterns: Catastrophizing—"I can't stand this." Attribution—"They're doing this on purpose." Helplessness—"I'm trapped."

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

These feel true but are not facts. They make reactions worse.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Reframing Statements ---

Instead of "I can't stand this," try: "This is uncomfortable, but I can handle it."

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Instead of "They're doing this on purpose," try: "This is just a sound. It's not about me."

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Instead of "I have to escape," try: "I can stay and use my tools. I have options."

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Your Core Reframe ---

Repeat internally: "This is a sound. Sounds cannot harm me. I am uncomfortable but safe. I can handle this."

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Again: "This is a sound. Sounds cannot harm me. I am uncomfortable but safe. I can handle this."

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- The Observer Perspective ---

Instead of "I am angry," try: "I notice anger arising." This creates distance. You are not the reaction—you are observing it.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Anchor Reinforcement ---

Press thumb into palm now, reinforcing your anchor.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

This anchor carries cognitive reframing. Sounds cannot harm you. You are uncomfortable but safe.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Say internally: "I choose my thoughts about sounds. I can reframe any trigger."

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Release your thumb.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== POST-HYPNOTIC SUGGESTIONS (1 minute) ===

When triggered, you will notice your thoughts. You will recognize when thoughts are amplifying distress.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

You will reframe: "Sounds cannot harm me. I can handle this."

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your thinking about sounds is changing. Your reactions are softening.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== EMERGENCE (2-3 minutes) ===

It is time to return to full awareness, bringing cognitive flexibility with you.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

I will count from one to five. With each number, you become more alert while new thinking patterns strengthen.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

One. Beginning to return. New thoughts installed.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Two. Energy returning. Flexible now.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Three. Reframes available.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Four. Almost fully alert. Observer perspective ready.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Five. Eyes open, fully awake, completely alert, and cognitively flexible.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Welcome back, Austin. Remember: "Sounds cannot harm me. I am uncomfortable but safe. I can handle this."
