Duration: ~6 minutes
Voice: Male, British accent, calm but grounding

[BEGIN SCRIPT]

Austin, you are caught in overthinking. That is why you pressed play. Good choice. Let me help you break free.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

First, breathe. Deep breath in... hold... and release slowly.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Again. Breathe in calm... hold... release the spinning thoughts.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Press your stillness anchor now. Thumb to middle finger. Feel your mind slowing. The loops interrupting. Space opening.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Notice what you are overthinking about. Is it past or future? Because the present moment is peaceful. What is actually happening right now?

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Right now, you are safe. Right now, nothing requires your endless analysis. Right now, there is only this breath.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

If thoughts are looping, place them in the box. Close the lid. They will wait. You do not need to solve everything now.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

If you are avoiding action through thinking, ask: What is the smallest step I could take? Just one tiny action to break the loop.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

If the critic is speaking, respond: Thank you, I hear you. But I am choosing kindness right now. I am doing my best.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One more breath... and release. The overthinking is fading. Your mind is clearing. You have interrupted the loop.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Return to your day, Austin. One thing at a time. You are in control of your thoughts.
