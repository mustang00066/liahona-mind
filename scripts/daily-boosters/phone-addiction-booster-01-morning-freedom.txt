Duration: ~7 minutes
Voice: Male, British accent, calm and grounding

[BEGIN SCRIPT]

Good morning, Austin. Before you reach for your phone, listen to this. Start your day with intention, not reaction.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Take a deep breath in... hold... and release slowly.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Another breath, centering yourself in this new day.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Press your clarity anchor now. Thumb to pinky. Feel the freedom of an uncluttered mind. This is how your morning should feel.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Set your intention: Today, I will use my phone with purpose. I will not reach automatically. I will be present with people. I will choose connection over distraction.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

What truly matters today? Not notifications. Not likes. Your work. Your family. Your growth. Your peace.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The phone can wait. It will still be there. But this morning belongs to you.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Remember your boundaries. When will you first check? What spaces are phone-free? Honor these limits today.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The scripture says, This is the day which the Lord hath made. Live it fully. Be present. Do not scroll away these precious hours.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One more breath... and release. You are ready, Austin. Start your day free. The phone serves you, not the other way around.
