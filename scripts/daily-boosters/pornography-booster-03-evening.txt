If you had victories today, acknowledge them. Each moment of resistance matters. Each healthy choice strengthens your new pathways. Be proud of yourself.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

If you struggled, do not despair. Every day is a new opportunity. What can you learn? What will you do differently tomorrow? Growth comes from reflection.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

How was your HALT status today? Did hunger, anger, loneliness, or tiredness affect you? Plan to address any lingering needs before sleep.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Release any tension from the day now. Whatever stress you carry, let it go. Tomorrow is fresh. Tonight is for rest.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The scripture says, His mercies are new every morning. Whatever today held, mercy awaits you tomorrow. Grace covers your imperfections.

As you sleep tonight, your subconscious mind will continue its healing work. The old pathways weaken. The new pathways strengthen. Recovery happens even in rest.

Set your intention for tomorrow: Tomorrow, I will be vigilant. Tomorrow, I will be strong. Tomorrow, I will live in freedom.
