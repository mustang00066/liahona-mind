Duration: ~6 minutes
Voice: Male, British accent, warm and grounding

[BEGIN SCRIPT]

Austin, you are about to see your family, or you have just arrived home. Take a moment to prepare for full presence.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Take a deep breath in... hold... and release, letting go of wherever you just came from.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Another breath, transitioning fully to family mode.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Put your phone away. Not in your pocket—away. Your family deserves your eyes, not the glow of a screen.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Set your intention: For the next hours, I will be present. I will see my family. I will hear them. I will be with them.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let go of work thoughts. They can wait. Let go of worries. They will not be solved tonight. Be here, now.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When you see your family, really see them. Make eye contact. Give a genuine greeting. Not routine, but real.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Ask a question that shows interest. Not how was your day in passing, but something that waits for an answer.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your family has been waiting for you. Give them what they need—your presence.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One more breath... and release. You are ready. Go be with your family, Austin. They are your treasure.
