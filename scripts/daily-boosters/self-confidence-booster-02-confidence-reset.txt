[BEGIN SCRIPT]

Austin, your confidence has wavered. That is why you pressed play. Good choice. Let me help you reset.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

First, breathe. Deep breath in... hold... and release slowly.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Again. Breathe in strength... hold... release the doubt.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Press your worth anchor now. Thumb to ring finger. Feel your worth returning. You are valuable. This moment does not change that.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Whatever triggered this doubt, remember: it is about behavior or circumstances, not your fundamental worth. Your worth is inherent. Unchangeable.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Adjust your posture now. Head up. Shoulders back. Chest open. Feel how this changes your state.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

What would the confident you say about this situation? That you can handle it. That you have handled similar things before. That one setback does not define you.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

What strengths can you bring to this moment? You have capabilities. Use them.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The doubt is fading. Can you feel it? You are resetting. Your confidence is returning.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One more breath... and release. You are ready again, Austin. You are capable. You are enough. Return to your day with confidence restored.
