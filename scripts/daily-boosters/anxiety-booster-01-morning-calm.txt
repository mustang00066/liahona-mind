Duration: ~7 minutes
Voice: Male, British accent, calm and centering

[BEGIN SCRIPT]

Good morning, Austin. Before your day begins, let us set the foundation for calm. A peaceful morning creates a peaceful day.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Take a deep breath in... hold... and release slowly.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Another breath, centering yourself in the present moment.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Today is a new day. Whatever happened yesterday is past. Whatever may happen today is still unknown. Right now, in this moment, you are at peace.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Press your peace anchor now. Thumb to finger. Feel the calm flowing through you. This calm is available all day long.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Do a quick body scan. Shoulders—release any tension. Jaw—let it relax. Breath—make it deep. Three points of calm.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Set your intention for today: Today, I will remain calm. When challenges arise, I will use my tools. I am equipped. I am capable.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The scripture reminds us, This is the day which the Lord hath made; we will rejoice and be glad in it. Today is a gift. Receive it with peace.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

If anxious thoughts arise today, remember: they are just thoughts, not facts. Question them. Balance them. Let them go.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

If uncertainty troubles you today, remember: I do not know, and that is okay. Do your part. Release the rest.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One more breath... and release. You are ready, Austin. Go into your day with calm confidence. Peace is with you.
