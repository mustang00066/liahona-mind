Good morning, Austin. Before your day begins, let us establish your confidence. A powerful morning creates a powerful day.

Take a deep breath in... hold... and release slowly.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Another breath, standing tall in your mind even now.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Press your worth anchor. Thumb to ring finger. Feel your inherent value flooding in. You are worthy. You matter.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Check your posture now, or imagine it. Head high. Shoulders back. Chest open. This is how you will carry yourself today.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Set your intention: Today, I will remember my worth. I will speak with confidence. I will act on my strengths. I will handle criticism well. I will maintain my boundaries.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

What strengths will you use today? Remember them now. You have gifts. Use them.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

If self-doubt arises today, you will recognize it and dismiss it. That is fear, not truth.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The scripture promises, Be strong and of a good courage. Today, you are strong. Today, you are courageous.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One more breath... and release. You are ready, Austin. Go into your day with confidence. You are capable. You are enough.
