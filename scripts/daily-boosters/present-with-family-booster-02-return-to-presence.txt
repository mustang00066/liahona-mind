Duration: ~5 minutes
Voice: Male, British accent, warm and gentle

[BEGIN SCRIPT]

Austin, you have noticed you drifted away. Your body is with your family, but your mind went elsewhere. Good—noticing is the first step.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Take a breath. Deep breath in... hold... and release, returning to now.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Where did you go? Work worries? Phone thoughts? Future plans? It does not matter. What matters is returning.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Look around you now. Who is with you? See them. Really see them.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your children are growing every day. Your spouse is living their life beside yours. These moments will not return. Be here for them.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Put down whatever is in your hands. Set aside whatever is in your mind. Say silently: I am here now. This moment matters.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Engage with your family. Ask a question. Make eye contact. Touch someone. Reconnect.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The moment you drifted is gone, but this moment is here. Be present for this one.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One more breath... and release. You have returned, Austin. Stay present. Your family needs you here.
