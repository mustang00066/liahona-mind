Duration: ~6 minutes
Voice: Male, British accent, calm but grounding

[BEGIN SCRIPT]

Austin, you are feeling the pull of your phone. That is why you pressed play. Good choice. Let me help you ride out this urge.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

First, breathe. Deep breath in... hold... and release slowly.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Again. Breathe in presence... hold... release the pull.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Press your clarity anchor now. Thumb to pinky. Feel the clarity returning. You do not need the phone right now.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

What triggered this urge? Boredom? Anxiety? Habit? Notice without judgment.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

What do you actually need right now? The phone cannot provide real connection, real peace, real fulfillment. What do you truly need?

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The urge will pass. It always does. It feels urgent, but it is not. Nothing on that phone requires your immediate attention.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Think of what you will miss if you pick up the phone. The present moment. The people near you. Your own thoughts.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Think of how you will feel after scrolling. Empty. Time lost. Slightly worse than before.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The urge is fading. You are riding it out. This is strength. This is freedom.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One more breath... and release. You did it. The urge has passed. Return to your life, Austin. It is better than the screen.
