PORNOGRAPHY & MASTURBATION ADDICTION - DAILY BOOSTER 2: Urge Emergency Response
Duration: ~7 minutes
Voice: Male, British accent, calm but urgent

[BEGIN SCRIPT]

Austin, you are experiencing an urge. That is why you pressed play. Good choice. Listen to my voice and let the urge pass.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

First, breathe. Deep breath in... hold... and release slowly.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Again. Breathe in peace... hold... release the tension.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The urge you feel is temporary. It is a wave. It will rise, peak, and fall. You do not have to act on it. You just have to wait.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Press your thumb and finger together now. Feel your strength anchor activate. Power is flowing through you. You are stronger than this urge.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Remember who you are. You are someone who does not do this. This urge is a remnant of old programming, not a reflection of your true self.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Think forward. How will you feel in one hour if you act out? Shame. Regret. Disappointment. How will you feel if you resist? Pride. Strength. Freedom.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The choice is clear. You know what you want. You know who you are. The urge is weakening already. Keep breathing.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The Savior was tempted in all points, yet without sin. He understands what you feel. His strength is available to you right now.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The urge is fading. Can you feel it? It's passing. You are winning. Keep breathing. Keep holding on.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One more breath... and release. The crisis is passing. You did it, Austin. You let the urge pass without acting. This is victory.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Now, do something different. Move. Call someone. Leave the room. Change your state. Go, Austin. You are free.
