Good morning, Austin. Take a moment to center yourself as you begin your day. A deep breath in... and release.

Close your eyes briefly. Feel your hands resting comfortably. Notice your fingers, your palms, your nails. These are your hands, and you care for them.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Today, you will be aware. You will notice any urges that arise, and you will respond with the competing response. You will make healthy choices for your hands.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

See yourself moving through this day with your hands protected. Whatever triggers you encounter, you handle them skillfully. Your nails remain untouched.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You are someone who takes care of their hands. This is your identity. This is your truth.

The scripture says, I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me. Today, His strength supports you in keeping your hands healthy.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Set your intention now: Today, my hands are safe. My nails are protected. I am in control.

Take one more breath, feeling confident and prepared... and release.
