Duration: ~6 minutes
Voice: Male, British accent, calm but supportive

[BEGIN SCRIPT]

Austin, you are feeling anxious. That is why you pressed play. Good choice. Let me help you find calm.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

First, breathe. Deep breath in... hold... and release slowly.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Again. Breathe in peace... hold... release the tension.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Press your peace anchor now. Thumb to finger. Feel the calm returning. You have trained for this moment.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Quick body scan. Where is the anxiety sitting? Shoulders? Tense. Release them. Drop them. Jaw? Clenched. Let it go. Stomach? Knotted. Soften it.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The anxiety is already decreasing. You are taking control.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Now, what thought triggered this anxiety? Notice it. Is it a fact or a fear? Is it definitely true, or just a possibility?

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Most anxious thoughts are predictions, not facts. You are fortune-telling disaster. But you do not know the future.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

What is a more balanced thought? Not falsely positive, but realistic. Find that balance.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

If this is about something you cannot control, remember the prayer: Lord, I give this to you. I have done what I can. The rest is yours.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

I do not know, and that is okay. Say it: I do not know, and that is okay.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One more breath... and release. The worst is passing. You did it. You used your tools. The anxiety is manageable now.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Return to your day, Austin. You have handled this moment well. Peace is with you.
