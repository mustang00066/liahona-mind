[BEGIN SCRIPT]

Good morning, Austin. Before your day begins, let us set your mind to calm. A clear morning creates a clear day.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Take a deep breath in... hold... and release slowly.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Another breath, centering yourself in this present moment.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Press your stillness anchor now. Thumb to middle finger. Feel your mind quieting. The chatter settling. Peace arriving.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Today, you will think clearly. You will think enough, not too much. When analysis becomes avoidance, you will act.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Set your intention: Today, I will be present. I will focus on one thing at a time. When thoughts loop, I will interrupt them.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

If decisions arise, remember: Clarify, gather reasonable information, trust your gut, decide, commit. You do not need certainty. You need action.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

If the inner critic speaks, answer with kindness. I am learning. I am growing. I am enough.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The scripture promises peace beyond understanding. Today, that peace is yours. A calm mind, a clear focus, a productive day.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One more breath... and release. You are ready, Austin. Go into your day with a quiet mind. You are capable.
