=== PRE-TALK / SETTLING (1-2 minutes) ===

Welcome back, Austin. Today we focus on mindful eating—not a diet, but a way of relating to food that transforms eating into a conscious, nourishing act.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Many of us eat mindlessly—while distracted, too quickly, past fullness. This leads to poor choices and overeating.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let us develop mindful eating.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== INDUCTION - Rapid Relaxation with Breathing (5-6 minutes) ===

Take a deep breath now. Diaphragmatic breathing—belly expanding as you breathe in, sinking as you breathe out.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Breathe in through your nose... belly rising gently... hold for a moment... and release. You can develop a peaceful relationship with food.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Another breath... deeper... and as you exhale, allow your eyes to close naturally.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let your neck become loose like rubber bands. Head floating. Jaws sagging. Shoulders dropping.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Arms becoming limp, loose, and heavy. All the way down to your hands.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Legs and feet the same. The better you feel, the deeper you go. Awareness growing.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Your eyelids becoming wonderfully heavy. As though gently stuck together. Ready to nourish.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== DEEPENING (3-4 minutes) ===

Imagine yourself at the top of a staircase... ten steps leading down to a place of nourishment.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Ten. Stepping down. Food awareness growing.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Nine. Deeper. Mindfulness developing.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Eight. Ready for transformation.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Seven. Deeper still.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Six. Halfway there.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Five. So aware. So present.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Four. Almost there.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Three. Deep nourishment.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Two. One more step.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

One. You enter a place of nourishment. Here you can develop mindful eating. Everything you learn will transform your meals.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== THERAPEUTIC CONTENT (8-10 minutes) ===

--- What Mindful Eating Is ---

Mindful eating is paying attention when you eat—noticing the food, noticing your body, eating deliberately rather than automatically.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- The Hunger-Fullness Scale ---

Imagine a scale from one to ten. One is ravenous. Ten is painfully stuffed.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Eat when you reach three or four—genuinely hungry. Stop when you reach six or seven—satisfied but not stuffed.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Before eating, check: What is my hunger level? During eating, check: What is my fullness level?

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Eating Slowly ---

It takes twenty minutes for your brain to receive fullness signals. Eat quickly and you overeat before those signals arrive.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Put your fork down between bites. Chew thoroughly. Aim for twenty-minute meals.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Emotional Eating ---

Before eating, ask: Am I physically hungry, or eating for another reason?

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

If not physically hungry, pause. What are you actually feeling? What do you actually need? Food cannot meet emotional needs—only mask them.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- The Practice ---

Before eating: Pause, check hunger, take a breath.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

While eating: Eat slowly, put down utensils, check fullness.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

When satisfied: Stop, even if food remains.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Anchor Reinforcement ---

Place your hand on your belly, reinforcing your anchor.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

This anchor carries mindful eating. Say internally: "I eat with awareness. I honor hunger and fullness."

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Release your hand.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== POST-HYPNOTIC SUGGESTIONS (1 minute) ===

You will pause before eating and check hunger level. You will eat slowly.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

You will distinguish physical hunger from emotional hunger. You will stop when satisfied.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== EMERGENCE (2-3 minutes) ===

It is time to return to full awareness, bringing mindful eating with you.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

I will count from one to five. With each number, you become more alert while awareness strengthens.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

One. Beginning to return. Mindfulness installed.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Two. Energy returning. Aware.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Three. Hunger-fullness connected.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Four. Almost fully alert. Nourished.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Five. Eyes open, fully awake, completely alert, and ready to eat mindfully.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Welcome back, Austin. At your next meal, practice. Pause, eat slowly, check fullness. Notice how different it feels.
