HEALTHY PHYSICAL CHOICES - TOOLBOX
10 Non-Hypnotherapy Tools for Daily Use

These tools are practical techniques you can use anytime, anywhere. They complement the hypnotherapy sessions and help you maintain healthy physical choices in daily life.

---

TOOL 1: THE BELLY ANCHOR

What it is: A physical anchor conditioned during hypnotherapy that connects you to body wisdom, mindful eating, sleep practices, movement joy, and craving mastery.

How to use it:
1. When you need body awareness, place your hand gently on your belly
2. Hold for 3-5 seconds while taking a deep breath
3. Connect with your body: "I listen to my body. I honor its needs."
4. Release and proceed with awareness

When to use it: Before meals (to eat mindfully), when cravings hit, before bed (to prepare for sleep), when deciding whether to move, any time you need to reconnect with body wisdom.

Key insight: The anchor grows stronger each time you use it. It connects you to everything you have learned about caring for your body.

TOOL 2: THE HUNGER-FULLNESS SCALE

What it is: A simple 1-10 scale to assess physical hunger and satiation.

The Scale:
1 = Ravenously hungry (weak, irritable, can't concentrate)
2 = Very hungry (stomach growling loudly)
3 = Hungry (ready to eat, stomach signaling)
4 = Slightly hungry (could eat but not urgent)
5 = Neutral (neither hungry nor full)
6 = Satisfied (comfortable, had enough)
7 = Full (pleasantly full)
8 = Very full (too full, uncomfortable)
9 = Stuffed (painfully full)
10 = Sick (nauseous from overeating)

How to use it:
- Before eating: Check where you are. Ideally, eat at 3-4.
- During eating: Check periodically. Aim to stop at 6-7.
- After eating: Notice where you ended. Learn from patterns.

When to use it: Every meal. Make it automatic to check before, during, and after.

Key insight: Most overeating happens because we don't check in. The simple act of asking "What number am I?" changes everything.

TOOL 3: THE MINDFUL BITE PRACTICE

What it is: A technique for eating more slowly and with greater awareness.

How to use it:
1. Take a bite of food
2. Put your utensil down
3. Chew thoroughly (15-20 times if possible)
4. Notice the taste, texture, temperature as you chew
5. Swallow completely before picking up utensil
6. Take a breath
7. Pick up utensil for next bite
8. Repeat

When to use it: At least the first 5 bites of every meal. For the whole meal when possible.

Key insight: This one practice can transform your relationship with food. Slow eating leads to eating less, enjoying more, and feeling satisfied.

TOOL 4: THE SLEEP HYGIENE CHECKLIST

What it is: A checklist of practices that support quality sleep.

Daily Checklist:
[ ] No caffeine after noon
[ ] No alcohol within 3 hours of bed
[ ] No screens 1 hour before bed
[ ] Bedroom cool (65-68°F)
[ ] Bedroom dark (blackout curtains or eye mask)
[ ] Bedroom quiet (or white noise)
[ ] Consistent bedtime: ________
[ ] Consistent wake time: ________
[ ] Wind-down routine started 1 hour before bed

Wind-Down Routine Ideas:
- Dim lights in home
- Change into sleep clothes
- Light stretching
- Reading (paper, not screen)
- Prayer or meditation
- Journaling
- Hygiene routine (brush teeth, etc.)

When to use it: Review weekly to ensure practices are in place. Troubleshoot when sleep quality declines.

Key insight: Sleep problems usually trace back to one or more of these practices being neglected. Fix the practice, fix the sleep.

---

TOOL 5: THE 4-7-8 BREATH

What it is: A breathing technique that activates the relaxation response and promotes sleep.

How to use it:
1. Exhale completely through your mouth
2. Inhale through your nose for 4 counts
3. Hold your breath for 7 counts
4. Exhale through your mouth for 8 counts
5. Repeat 3-4 times

When to use it: In bed when having trouble falling asleep, when feeling stressed, when cravings feel overwhelming, any time you need to activate calm.

Key insight: The extended exhale activates your parasympathetic nervous system, shifting your body from stress mode to rest mode. This is biology, not just psychology.

---

TOOL 6: THE MOVEMENT MENU

What it is: A pre-planned list of movement options so you never have to decide what to do.

Create Your Menu:

QUICK OPTIONS (10-15 min):
1. _________________________________
2. _________________________________
3. _________________________________

MODERATE OPTIONS (20-30 min):
1. _________________________________
2. _________________________________
3. _________________________________

FULL WORKOUTS (45+ min):
1. _________________________________
2. _________________________________
3. _________________________________

ACTIVE REST (low intensity):
1. _________________________________
2. _________________________________
3. _________________________________

How to use it: When it's time to move, consult your menu based on available time and energy. Having options removes decision fatigue.

Key insight: The best exercise is the one you'll actually do. Build your menu around movement you genuinely enjoy or at least find tolerable.

TOOL 7: THE URGE SURF

What it is: A technique for riding out cravings without acting on them.

How to use it:
1. When a craving hits, pause. Don't act immediately.
2. Notice where you feel the craving in your body (mouth, stomach, chest)
3. Rate its intensity (1-10)
4. Observe without judging. The craving is a sensation, nothing more.
5. Imagine it as a wave: it rises, crests, and falls
6. Breathe slowly and ride the wave
7. Notice the intensity decreasing over time
8. Continue until the wave has passed (usually 10-20 minutes)

When to use it: Any time a craving feels overwhelming and you want to make a conscious choice rather than an automatic one.

Key insight: Cravings are like waves—they ALWAYS pass if you don't feed them. Each successful surf strengthens your ability to surf again.

---

TOOL 8: THE DELAY TECHNIQUE

What it is: A simple strategy for creating space between craving and action.

How to use it:
1. When a craving hits, say to yourself: "Not yet. I'll wait 10 minutes."
2. Set a timer if helpful
3. Do something else during the delay—drink water, take a walk, do a task
4. When the timer ends, check in: Is the craving still there? How strong?
5. If still strong, you can consciously choose. If diminished, you've won.

When to use it: Whenever you're about to reach for food automatically. The pause creates choice.

Key insight: Most cravings diminish significantly within 10-20 minutes. The delay is often all you need.

TOOL 9: THE WEEKLY BODY CHECK-IN

What it is: A structured weekly review to assess each pillar of physical health.

Weekly Questions:

NOURISHMENT:
- How mindfully did I eat this week? (1-10)
- Did I stop when satisfied most meals?
- What patterns do I notice?
- One adjustment for next week: _________________

SLEEP:
- Average hours of sleep: _______
- Sleep quality: (1-10)
- Did I maintain my routine?
- One adjustment for next week: _________________

MOVEMENT:
- How many days did I move?
- What activities did I do?
- How did I feel?
- One adjustment for next week: _________________

CRAVINGS:
- How well did I manage cravings? (1-10)
- What triggered cravings?
- What worked?
- One adjustment for next week: _________________

OVERALL:
- Body wisdom connection: (1-10)
- What am I proud of?
- What needs attention?

When to use it: Weekly, same day each week. Takes 5-10 minutes.

Key insight: What gets measured gets managed. The check-in keeps you aware and allows course correction.

---

TOOL 10: THE HALT CHECK

What it is: A quick assessment before eating to determine if you're truly hungry or eating for another reason.

HALT = Hungry, Angry, Lonely, Tired

How to use it:
Before eating (especially between meals or when craving), ask:

Am I HUNGRY?
- Is my stomach empty/growling?
- When did I last eat?
- Where am I on the hunger scale?

Am I ANGRY (or stressed/anxious)?
- Am I using food to cope with emotions?
- What am I actually feeling?
- What do I actually need?

Am I LONELY (or bored)?
- Am I eating because I have nothing else to do?
- Am I eating for comfort or connection?
- What do I actually need?

Am I TIRED?
- Am I reaching for food for energy?
- Would rest serve me better?
- Is this sugar craving really exhaustion?

If it's not genuine hunger, address the actual need instead of eating.

When to use it: Every time you reach for food outside regular meals. Make it automatic.

Key insight: Food only satisfies hunger. If you're eating for other reasons, food won't help—it only masks the real need temporarily.
