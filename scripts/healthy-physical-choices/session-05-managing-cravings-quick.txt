=== PRE-TALK / SETTLING (1-2 minutes) ===

Welcome back, Austin. Today we focus on managing cravings—those powerful urges that can override your best intentions.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Cravings are not commands. They are sensations that arise and pass. You can learn to observe them without obeying them.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let us master your cravings.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== INDUCTION - Rapid Relaxation with Breathing (5-6 minutes) ===

Take a deep breath now. Diaphragmatic breathing—belly expanding as you breathe in, sinking as you breathe out.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Breathe in through your nose... belly rising gently... hold for a moment... and release. You can choose consciously.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Another breath... deeper... and as you exhale, allow your eyes to close naturally.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let your neck become loose like rubber bands. Head floating. Jaws sagging. Shoulders dropping.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Arms becoming limp, loose, and heavy. All the way down to your hands.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Legs and feet the same. The better you feel, the deeper you go. Mastery building.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Your eyelids becoming wonderfully heavy. As though gently stuck together. Ready for control.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== DEEPENING (3-4 minutes) ===

Imagine yourself at the top of a staircase... ten steps leading down to a place of mastery.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Ten. Stepping down. Mastery growing.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Nine. Deeper. Control developing.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Eight. Ready for wisdom.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Seven. Deeper still.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Six. Halfway there.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Five. So conscious. So in control.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Four. Almost there.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Three. Deep mastery.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Two. One more step.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

One. You enter a place of mastery. Here you can navigate cravings with wisdom. Everything you learn will strengthen your choices.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== THERAPEUTIC CONTENT (8-10 minutes) ===

Receive only what serves you. Your subconscious mind will accept what is true for you and let the rest go.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

--- Understanding Cravings ---

Cravings are brain patterns, not moral failings. They are partly biological—wired for sugar, salt, fat. Partly learned—habit loops that reinforce.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

They can be changed.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- What Cravings Really Want ---

Sometimes you crave food when actually thirsty—drink water first.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Sometimes when tired—you need rest, not sugar.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Sometimes when emotional—food numbs feelings but doesn't address them.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Before obeying a craving, ask: What am I really needing?

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Urge Surfing ---

Cravings rise and fall like waves—usually within fifteen to twenty minutes if you do not feed them.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When a craving hits, observe it. Where do you feel it? How intense? Watch it crest and recede.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Each time you surf an urge, you strengthen your ability to do so again.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- The Delay Strategy ---

When a craving hits, say not yet. Wait ten minutes. Do something else.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Often by the end of the delay, the craving has passed or diminished.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Avoiding Triggers ---

Reduce exposure: Do not keep tempting foods in the house. Notice situational triggers.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When you choose to indulge, do so mindfully. Taste it fully. Small amount mindfully beats large amount mindlessly.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Anchor Reinforcement ---

Place your hand on your belly, reinforcing your anchor.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

This anchor carries craving mastery. Say internally: "Cravings are sensations, not commands. I choose consciously."

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Release your hand.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== POST-HYPNOTIC SUGGESTIONS (1 minute) ===

When cravings arise, you will pause and ask what you really need.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

You will use urge surfing and delay to ride out cravings. You will choose consciously.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== EMERGENCE (2-3 minutes) ===

It is time to return to full awareness, bringing craving mastery with you.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

I will count from one to five. With each number, you become more alert while mastery strengthens.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

One. Beginning to return. Mastery installed.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Two. Energy returning. In control.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Three. Conscious choosing.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Four. Almost fully alert. Free.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Five. Eyes open, fully awake, completely alert, and master of your cravings.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Welcome back, Austin. This week, when a craving hits, try urge surfing or delay. Notice how it rises and falls. You are in control.
