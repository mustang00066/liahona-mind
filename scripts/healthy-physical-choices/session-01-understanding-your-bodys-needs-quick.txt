=== PRE-TALK / SETTLING (1-2 minutes) ===

Welcome, Austin. You are here to develop a healthier relationship with your body—making choices that nourish rather than deplete you.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Your body is a remarkable gift. "Know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost?" Treating it well is stewardship and gratitude.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let us begin developing a healthier relationship with your physical self.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== INDUCTION - Rapid Relaxation with Breathing (5-6 minutes) ===

Take a deep breath now. Diaphragmatic breathing—belly expanding as you breathe in, sinking as you breathe out.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Breathe in through your nose... belly rising gently... hold for a moment... and release. Your body wants to be healthy.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Another breath... deeper... and as you exhale, allow your eyes to close naturally.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let your neck become loose like rubber bands. Head floating. Jaws sagging. Shoulders dropping.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Arms becoming limp, loose, and heavy. All the way down to your hands.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Legs and feet the same. The better you feel, the deeper you go. Body awareness growing.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Your eyelids becoming wonderfully heavy. As though gently stuck together. Ready to understand.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== THERAPEUTIC CONTENT (8-10 minutes) ===

--- Your Body as a Gift ---

Your body is a gift—not an enemy, not something to fight. It is your partner, deserving care, respect, and gratitude.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- The Four Pillars ---

Your body has fundamental needs: nourishment (fuel), rest (recovery), movement (activity), and care (maintenance).

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When these are met, you have energy and vitality. When neglected, you suffer.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Listening to Your Body ---

Your body constantly communicates. Hunger signals fuel needed. Fatigue signals rest needed. Pain signals something wrong.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Reconnecting means learning to listen again—noticing signals and responding appropriately.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Body Awareness Practice ---

Notice your body now. Any tension? Your energy level? Any hunger or thirst? Any discomfort?

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

This awareness is available anytime you pause and check in.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Your Why ---

Why do you want healthier choices? Energy for family? Longevity? Feeling good? Honoring God?

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Hold your why clearly. It will motivate when choices are difficult.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Installing the Anchor ---

Place your hand gently on your belly—the center of your body.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Feel the warmth. This gesture represents connection—listening to your body, honoring its needs.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Say internally: "I listen to my body. I honor its needs. My body is a gift."

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Release your hand.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== POST-HYPNOTIC SUGGESTIONS (1 minute) ===

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

You will listen to your body's signals and respond appropriately.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Your anchor connects you to body wisdom.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== EMERGENCE (2-3 minutes) ===

It is time to return to full awareness, bringing body connection with you.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

I will count from one to five. With each number, you become more alert while awareness strengthens.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

One. Beginning to return. Awareness installed.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Two. Energy returning. Grateful for this gift.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Three. Listening more closely.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Four. Almost fully alert. Connected.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Welcome back, Austin. Practice listening to your body this week. Notice hunger, fullness, fatigue. Use your anchor. Your body is speaking—learn to hear it.
