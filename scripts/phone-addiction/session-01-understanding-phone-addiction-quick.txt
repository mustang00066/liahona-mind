Duration: ~28 minutes
Voice: Male, British accent, calm and insightful

[BEGIN SCRIPT]

Welcome, Austin. You have recognized something important: your phone has too much power over you. Today, you begin taking that power back.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Put your phone somewhere you cannot see it. Take a deep breath in... hold... and release, beginning to detach.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Another breath, deeper... noticing life without the phone... hold... and release.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One more breath... eyes closing, attention fully here.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let the golden light clear digital fog. Head to toe. Mind becoming clearer. Eyes resting from screens.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Descend now. Ten to one. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Deep awareness.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Phone addiction is real. Apps are designed to be addictive. Variable rewards, infinite scroll. You are facing a designed trap.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Each notification triggers dopamine. Your brain expects these hits. When they do not come, you feel restless. This is withdrawal.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Consider what you have lost to phone time. Conversations not present for. Sleep interrupted. Time with family—half there, half in the phone.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The scripture warns against false idols. The phone can become one—demanding your first and last thoughts each day.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Phone addiction often masks something deeper. Boredom. Loneliness. Anxiety. As you reduce use, you will address these directly.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let us create a clarity anchor. Press your thumb and pinky together.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Feel the clarity of this phone-free moment. Present awareness. Freedom from the device.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Release. The anchor is set. When you feel the pull of the phone, press thumb to pinky and return to clarity.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One... beginning to return.
Two... feeling clear and motivated.
Three... becoming alert.
Four... refreshed and determined.
Five... eyes open, fully alert. You understand now, Austin. Change begins today.
