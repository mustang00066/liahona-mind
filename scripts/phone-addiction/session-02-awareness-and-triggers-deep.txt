=== PRE-TALK / SETTLING (2-3 minutes) ===

Welcome back, Austin. In our first session, you gained understanding of how phone addiction works. Today, we take the next crucial step: building awareness of your personal triggers.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

A trigger is anything that prompts you to reach for your phone. It could be an emotion, a situation, a time of day, or an environmental cue. Understanding your triggers gives you power over them.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Without awareness, the reach for the phone is automatic, unconscious, almost reflexive. With awareness, a space opens between trigger and response. In that space lives your freedom to choose.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Today, we will explore the different types of triggers, help you identify your personal patterns, and begin the practice of mindful observation that will serve you throughout this journey.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Put your phone somewhere you cannot see it. Find your comfortable position. Allow yourself to settle. Awareness is about to become your ally.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== INDUCTION - Eye Fatigue and Diaphragmatic Breathing (10-12 minutes) ===

Before we close your eyes, find a spot above your natural line of sight. Perhaps on the ceiling, perhaps high on the wall ahead. Focus your eyes on that spot now.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Notice how this upward gaze begins to tire your eye muscles. Let the tiredness come. It is the gateway to heightened awareness, to seeing patterns you have not seen before.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

As you maintain this gaze, begin your diaphragmatic breathing. Belly breathing... when you breathe in, your belly expands outward. When you breathe out, your belly button sinks back toward your spine.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Breathe in deeply through your nose... let your belly rise... hold for a moment... and release slowly through your mouth. This breathing prepares your mind to observe without judgment.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

Take another deep belly breath. Your eyes still focused upward... becoming heavier... more tired with each moment. Breathe in... belly expanding... hold... and release, feeling your capacity for observation expanding.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

One more breath. And as you exhale this time, allow your eyes to close. Let them fall shut with relief. Feel yourself entering a state of heightened awareness, where patterns become visible.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Now imagine your neck has become like a bundle of loose rubber bands. All tension dissolving. Your head floating gently... like a helium balloon... supported without any effort.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Allow your jaws to sag. Let your mouth open slightly. Your tongue resting loosely. Complete facial relaxation.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let your shoulders sag completely. Shoulders dropping... dropping... as low as they can go.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

Your arms and hands becoming limp, loose, and heavy. So limp, so loose, so heavy with relaxation... like heavy lead weights. So heavy it would take too much effort to lift them.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

Your legs and feet now. Let them go limp, loose, and heavy. Complete surrender to relaxation. Complete letting go.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

The better you feel, the deeper you go. And the deeper you go, the better you feel. A beautiful spiral of deepening peace and sharpening awareness.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Your eyelids now... so relaxed they've become wonderfully heavy. As though gently stuck together. This heaviness is clarity. This heaviness is the stillness from which you can observe.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

=== DEEPENING (8-10 minutes) ===

Now let's go deeper. Imagine yourself in an observation room overlooking your daily life. From here, you can watch your patterns without being caught in them. You are the observer, not the reactor.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Twenty steps will take you to this observation point. With each step, your awareness sharpens, your ability to see your triggers increases.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Twenty. You take the first step. Your observer mind awakening.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Nineteen. Another step. Patterns beginning to emerge.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Eighteen. Deeper now. Your automatic behaviors becoming visible.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Seventeen. The unconscious becoming conscious.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Sixteen. Going deeper. Your triggers coming into focus.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Fifteen. Halfway there. Clarity increasing.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Fourteen. Deeper and deeper with each step.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Thirteen. Your habits laid bare for gentle observation.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Twelve. No judgment here. Only curiosity.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Eleven. Your subconscious mind opening wide.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Ten. Ready for complete awareness.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Nine. Almost there. Your observer self fully present.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Eight. So deep now. So aware.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Seven. The observation room ahead.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Six. Just a few more steps.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Five. Profound stillness. Profound seeing.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Four. Ready for insight.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Three. Almost there.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Two. One more step.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

One. You stand in the observation room. From here, you can see your patterns clearly. From here, you can identify your triggers with precision and compassion.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

=== THERAPEUTIC CONTENT (15-18 minutes) ===

You remain in complete control. Your deeper mind will accept only the suggestions that align with your values and serve your growth. Everything else simply fades away.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

--- Types of Triggers ---

Austin, let us begin by understanding the different types of triggers that send your hand reaching for the phone. Triggers generally fall into four categories: emotional, environmental, social, and habitual.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Emotional triggers are perhaps the most powerful. These are feelings that prompt you to seek escape or numbing through the phone.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Boredom is a major emotional trigger. The moment nothing is happening, the phone appears. The discomfort of having nothing to do, nothing to occupy the mind, feels intolerable. The phone offers instant stimulation.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Anxiety is another powerful trigger. When worry arises, the phone offers distraction. You cannot think about what scares you if you are watching videos or scrolling feeds. But the distraction is temporary, and the anxiety waits.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Loneliness drives phone use. The promise of connection, of seeing what others are doing, of feeling part of something. Yet phone use often deepens loneliness rather than relieving it. The connection is shallow. The comparison is painful.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Stress sends you to the phone for relief. Work pressure, family demands, financial worry. The phone offers escape. But stress cannot be scrolled away. It compounds as tasks pile up while you distract yourself.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Sadness, frustration, anger, even happiness... almost any strong emotion can become a trigger. The phone becomes a way to manage feelings rather than feel them.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

--- Environmental Triggers ---

Environmental triggers are situations, locations, or times that automatically cue phone use.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The bedroom is often the most problematic. The phone by the bed means checking before sleep and immediately upon waking. These bookend behaviors shape your entire relationship with consciousness.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Waiting triggers checking. In line at the store. In the waiting room. At the red light. Any pause in activity becomes phone time. The ability to simply wait, to simply be, has atrophied.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Certain chairs or locations may be triggers. The couch where you always scroll. The bathroom where the phone accompanies you. The car where you check at every stop.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Time of day matters. The morning check. The lunch scroll. The evening binge. These become ritual, automatic, unquestioned.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

--- Social Triggers ---

Social triggers involve other people and the pressure of connection.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Fear of missing out... the worry that others are doing something interesting and you are not included. Social media preys on this fear, showing you everything you are supposedly missing.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The expectation of immediate response. Someone messages you and you feel compelled to reply instantly. Being unreachable feels rude, irresponsible, anxiety-provoking.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Social awkwardness triggers phone use. In a group where you feel uncomfortable, the phone provides escape. You look busy, engaged with something. But you miss the actual interaction happening around you.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Seeing others on their phones can trigger your own use. If everyone around you is checking, you do too. The behavior is contagious.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

--- Habitual Triggers ---

Some triggers are pure habit, divorced from any emotional or situational logic.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The hand reaches for the phone without any conscious thought. You find yourself checking without remembering deciding to check. This is habit at its most automatic.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Certain actions become paired with phone use. Eating means scrolling. Using the bathroom means watching videos. Lying down means checking. The phone becomes woven into other activities.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Sometimes you put down the phone, then pick it up again seconds later. No new information could have arrived. The reach is pure reflex, automatic and meaningless.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

--- Identifying Your Personal Triggers ---

Austin, now let us turn to your specific patterns. In the observation room of your mind, watch your typical day unfold.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

See yourself waking in the morning. What is your first impulse? Where is the phone? When does your hand first reach for it? Notice without judgment.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Watch yourself move through the morning. When does checking happen? What triggers it? Is it boredom while getting ready? Anxiety about the day ahead? Pure habit?

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Follow yourself through the day. When do you reach for the phone? During work breaks? In moments of stress? When you need to avoid a task?

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Notice the emotions that precede phone use. What are you feeling just before you check? This is valuable information. These feelings are your emotional triggers.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Notice the situations. What is happening around you when the urge arises? These are your environmental triggers.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Watch your evening. When does phone use peak? What triggers it? Tiredness? Desire to wind down? Avoidance of other activities?

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

See yourself before sleep. How does phone use end your day? What triggers that final check, that one more scroll?

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

--- The Space Between Trigger and Response ---

Here is the key insight: between the trigger and the response, there is a space. In that space lies your freedom.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Right now, that space may be very small. The trigger fires and the hand reaches almost simultaneously. But the space can be expanded with practice.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The goal is not to eliminate triggers. Triggers will always exist. Boredom will come. Anxiety will arise. Waits will happen. The goal is to recognize triggers and choose your response consciously.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

When you notice a trigger, simply name it. Boredom trigger. Anxiety trigger. Waiting trigger. This naming creates distance. You are observing the trigger rather than blindly responding to it.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

After naming, pause. Take a breath. Press your clarity anchor: thumb to pinky. In that pause, ask yourself: what do I actually need right now?

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Often, you will find that the phone cannot provide what you need. If you are lonely, the phone cannot give you real connection. If you are anxious, scrolling cannot give you peace. If you are bored, the phone offers only empty stimulation.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Sometimes you will still choose to use the phone. That is fine. The goal is conscious choosing, not perfect abstinence. But over time, you will choose differently more often.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

--- The Scripture Insight ---

The Savior taught, Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation. This watching is exactly what we are practicing today.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Watching means being aware. It means seeing the trigger before it captures you. It means maintaining consciousness rather than operating on autopilot.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Prayer can accompany this watching. When you notice a trigger, you can offer a brief, silent prayer: Help me choose wisely. This connects you to power beyond your own willpower.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Temptation is not sin. The trigger is not the problem. It is the unconscious, automatic response that entangles you. Watch the trigger, and you have a chance to respond differently.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

--- Strengthening the Anchor ---

Press your thumb and pinky finger together now.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Feel the clarity from Session One flowing in. Now add to it: awareness of triggers. The ability to see the urge before acting on it. The pause between stimulus and response.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Hold the pressure. When you notice a trigger, press thumb to pinky. Clarity flows in. Awareness sharpens. The automatic reach pauses. You have a choice.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Your anchor now carries two elements: clarity about phone addiction, and awareness of your triggers. Both give you power. Both create space for choice.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Release. The anchor is reinforced.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

--- Future Pacing ---

See yourself tomorrow. A trigger arises... boredom, perhaps. You feel the urge to reach for the phone. But something is different. You notice the trigger. You name it silently: boredom trigger.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

You press thumb to pinky. Clarity returns. You ask: what do I actually need? The pause extends. You might still choose to check the phone, or you might choose something else. But either way, you have chosen consciously.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

A week from now, trigger awareness has become a practice. You catch yourself more often. The automatic reach is interrupted more frequently. The space between trigger and response is growing.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

A month from now, you know your triggers well. Boredom, anxiety, waiting, certain times of day. You see them coming. You have strategies for responding differently. The unconscious has become conscious.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

=== POST-HYPNOTIC SUGGESTIONS (2-3 minutes) ===

The awareness you have developed today continues to sharpen. Each day, you notice your triggers more clearly.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When a trigger arises, you recognize it. You name it. This naming creates distance and gives you power.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your anchor is always available. Thumb to pinky when you feel the urge. The pause extends. Choice becomes possible.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Between trigger and response, a space is growing. In that space, your freedom lives. Guard it and expand it.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== EMERGENCE (3-5 minutes) ===

It's time now to return to full waking consciousness. But you take with you the observation room. Your ability to watch your own patterns remains with you.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

As I count from one to ten, you'll become gradually more alert, more awake, more refreshed... and more aware of your triggers.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One. Beginning to return. The observer self remains with you.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Two. Becoming aware of your body... so relaxed... so at peace.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Three. Feeling aware. Feeling observant. Feeling conscious.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Four. Energy beginning to return. Mind sharp and watchful.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Five. Halfway back. Your triggers now visible.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Six. More alert now. Fingers and toes may begin to move.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Seven. Feeling wonderful. Feeling aware. Feeling empowered.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Eight. Almost there. Taking a deep, refreshing breath.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Nine. Ready to open your eyes, ready to watch your triggers.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Ten. Eyes open, fully awake, completely alert, and newly aware.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Welcome back, Austin. Take a moment to feel this awareness... the ability to observe your own patterns, to see triggers before they capture you.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

In the coming days, practice watching. Notice when you reach for the phone. Notice what triggered the reach. Name it. Pause. Ask what you actually need. This simple practice transforms unconscious habit into conscious choice.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

You are becoming the observer of your habits, not their prisoner. The space between trigger and response is growing. Freedom lives in that space.
