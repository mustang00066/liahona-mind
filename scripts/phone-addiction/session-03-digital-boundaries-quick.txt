=== PRE-TALK / SETTLING (1-2 minutes) ===

Welcome back, Austin. Today we establish boundaries. Without limits, the phone will take everything. With boundaries, you reclaim your time and attention.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

A boundary is a limit you set. You decide how much the phone gets. You choose when and where it may intrude. These limits protect what matters most.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Put your phone aside. Find your comfortable position. Digital boundaries are about to become your shield.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== INDUCTION - Rapid Relaxation (5-6 minutes) ===

Take a deep diaphragmatic breath. Belly breathing... belly expands in, sinks down out.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Breathe in through your nose... belly rising... and release. Feel your resolve beginning to build.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Another breath... and as you exhale, allow your eyes to close.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let your neck become loose like rubber bands. Head floating. Jaws sagging. Complete facial relaxation.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Arms and hands becoming limp, loose, and heavy. Like lead weights. Legs and feet the same.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The better you feel, the deeper you go. The deeper you go, the better you feel.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your eyelids so relaxed they've become gently stuck together. This heaviness is protection. This heaviness is boundary.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== DEEPENING (3-4 minutes) ===

Imagine building a fence around a garden. The garden is your life. The fence is your digital boundaries. Ten steps to the center.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Ten. The garden is yours to protect.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Nine. Boundaries beginning to form.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Eight. Your resolve strengthening.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Seven. What belongs inside becoming clear.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Six. Your right to limits established.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Five. The phone cannot cross limits you set.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Four. Your life is yours to protect.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Three. Discipline building.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Two. Almost there.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

One. You stand in the center of your garden. From here, you build the fence.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== THERAPEUTIC CONTENT (8-10 minutes) ===

--- Types of Boundaries ---

Several types of boundaries can protect you. Time boundaries limit how much total time you spend on the phone or specific apps.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Screen-free times protect certain hours. The first hour after waking. The last hour before bed. Mealtimes. These belong to life, not the phone.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Place boundaries designate phone-free locations. The bedroom. The dining table. These spaces are for living, not scrolling.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Notification boundaries control interruptions. Turn off everything non-essential. You decide when to check, not the app.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

--- Choosing Your Boundaries ---

Austin, what boundaries would serve you? Consider your morning. What if the phone stayed elsewhere while you began your day?

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Consider mealtimes. What if the phone never appeared at the table? Consider evenings. What if the phone went away one hour before bed?

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

--- Installing Your Boundaries ---

See yourself waking. The phone is in another room. You begin your day without checking. You are present. This is your new normal.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

See yourself at meals. No phone in sight. You eat, you connect, you notice. This is how you eat now.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

See yourself in the evening. The phone goes to its place. Your last hour is screen-free. Sleep comes easily.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

These boundaries are now part of who you are. Protections you have chosen for yourself.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

--- Scripture Example ---

The Savior modeled boundaries. Though all sought Him, He withdrew regularly. He said no to demands that did not serve His mission. If He required limits, so do you.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

--- When Boundaries Feel Hard ---

Boundaries will feel uncomfortable at first. The discomfort is withdrawal. Push through. Use your anchor when it's hard. Press thumb to pinky. The boundary holds.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

--- Strengthening the Anchor ---

Press your thumb and pinky finger together now.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Feel clarity and awareness flowing in. Now add: the resolve of digital boundaries. The protection of limits. The freedom of saying no to the phone.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

When tempted to violate a boundary, press thumb to pinky. Clarity returns. The boundary holds.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Release. The anchor now carries three elements: clarity, awareness, and boundaries.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

--- Future Pacing ---

See yourself tomorrow. Boundaries in place. Morning boundary holds. Mealtime boundary holds. Evening boundary holds. You feel present, peaceful, free.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

A week from now, boundaries become routine. A month from now, they feel natural. The phone serves you, not the other way around.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== POST-HYPNOTIC SUGGESTIONS (1 minute) ===

Your boundaries grow stronger each day. When the urge to violate them arises, you pause, press your anchor, and the boundary holds.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Your phone serves you now. Your time and attention belong to you.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== EMERGENCE (2-3 minutes) ===

Time to return. The garden and its fence stay with you.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

One. Beginning to return. The garden remains.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Two. Becoming aware of your body. Relaxed and at peace.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Three. Feeling boundaried. Protected. Free.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Four. Energy returning. Mind sharp and resolved.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Five. Eyes open, fully awake, digitally boundaried.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Welcome back, Austin. Begin implementing your boundaries today. Start small if needed, but start. Each boundary honored strengthens your freedom. Your garden is protected now.
