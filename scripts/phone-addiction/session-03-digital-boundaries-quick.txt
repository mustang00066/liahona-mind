Duration: ~28 minutes
Voice: Male, British accent, calm and insightful

[BEGIN SCRIPT]

Welcome back, Austin. Today we establish boundaries. Without limits, the phone takes everything. With boundaries, you reclaim your time.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Put your phone aside. Take a deep breath in... hold... and release, feeling your space clear.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Another breath, deeper... preparing to establish limits... hold... and release.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One more breath... eyes closing, resolve strengthening.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let the golden light of boundaries create protective limits. Head to toe. Your attention stays yours.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Descend now. Ten to one. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Complete boundaries.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Time boundaries: Consider a daily limit. Consider screen-free times. The first hour after waking. Meals. One hour before bed.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Place boundaries: Phone-free spaces. Bedroom. Dinner table. The phone stays outside.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Notification boundaries: Turn off notifications for non-essential apps. You decide when to check.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

App boundaries: Which apps serve you? Which just consume you? Remove or limit the latter.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

See yourself waking. Phone stays charging elsewhere. First hour is yours.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

See meals, phone nowhere in sight. See evenings, phone put away an hour before bed.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Boundaries will feel difficult at first. This discomfort is temporary. The freedom is lasting.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Boundaries are protection, not punishment. They protect your time, attention, relationships, sleep.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One... beginning to return.
Two... feeling boundaried and free.
Three... becoming alert.
Four... refreshed and disciplined.
Five... eyes open, fully alert. Your boundaries are set, Austin. Honor them.
