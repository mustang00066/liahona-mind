Duration: ~28 minutes
Voice: Male, British accent, calm and insightful

[BEGIN SCRIPT]

Welcome back, Austin. Today we learn mindful technology use. The goal is not elimination, but intention. Conscious choice replaces compulsion.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Put your phone aside. Take a deep breath in... hold... and release, entering mindful awareness.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Another breath, deeper... cultivating intentionality... hold... and release.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One more breath... eyes closing, awareness sharpening.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let the golden light of mindfulness bring intention to all actions. Head to toe. Unconscious habits becoming conscious choices.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Descend now. Ten to one. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Complete mindfulness.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Mindful technology use means using your phone on purpose, for purpose. Not reaching automatically. Intentional engagement.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Before picking up your phone, pause. Ask: What am I going to do? Have a purpose.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Set a limit before you begin. Know when you will stop before you start.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

While using, stay aware. Notice if you drift into scrolling. When you notice, return to your purpose.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When purpose is fulfilled, stop. Put it down. Resist just check one more thing.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The scripture speaks of doing all things in wisdom and order. Mindful use is wisdom. Not prohibition—intentional engagement.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Imagine checking your calendar. Clear intention. Open it. See what you need. Put it down. Clean. Efficient. Satisfying.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Every pick-up will have a purpose. Every session will have a planned end. Intention becomes natural.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One... beginning to return.
Two... feeling aware and intentional.
Three... becoming alert.
Four... refreshed and mindful.
Five... eyes open, fully alert. Use your phone mindfully, Austin. On purpose, for purpose.
