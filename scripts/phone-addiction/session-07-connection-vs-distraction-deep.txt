Duration: ~38 minutes
Voice: Male, British accent, calm and insightful

[BEGIN SCRIPT]

Welcome back, Austin. Today we explore what you are missing when the phone captures your attention. The people in front of you. The moments passing by. Real connection versus digital distraction.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Put your phone far away. Take a deep breath in... hold gently... and release, becoming fully present.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Another breath, deeper... feeling what it means to be completely here... hold... and release, presence deepening.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

One more breath... breathing in connection... hold... and as you exhale, let your eyes close and your heart open to real relationships.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let the golden light of presence begin at your head. This light connects you to what is real. Scalp warming. Digital noise fading. The people in your life coming into focus.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The warmth flows through your body. Your eyes that could look at faces, not screens. Your ears that could hear voices, not notifications. Your hands that could touch, hold, embrace.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Now the staircase. Twenty steps down to deep connection.

Twenty, nineteen, eighteen, seventeen, sixteen... presence deepening.
Fifteen, fourteen, thirteen, twelve, eleven... people becoming clearer.
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six... relationships mattering more.
Five, four, three, two, one... complete connection achieved.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

You are in a place of true presence. Here, people matter more than devices. Here, moments are not missed.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Consider what you have missed while looking at your phone. Conversations with your children, half-heard. Time with your spouse, half-present. Gatherings with friends, watching through a camera instead of your eyes.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The phone promises connection but often delivers the opposite. You scroll others' highlight reels while missing your own life. You accumulate likes while neglecting those who love you.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The people in your life cannot compete with the phone's engineered stimulation. They may stop trying. They may accept your half-attention as normal. But it is not normal. It is not enough.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Children especially notice. They see where your eyes go. They learn what matters to you. What message does the phone send about their importance?

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The Savior was fully present with people. When He spoke with someone, they had His full attention. He looked at them. He heard them. He was there completely.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Presence is one of the greatest gifts you can give. Full attention says: You matter. You are worth my focus. There is nothing more important right now than you.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let us practice presence now. Imagine someone you love is in front of you. See their face clearly. Hear their voice. Feel their presence.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Give them your full attention. Not glancing at a phone. Not thinking about notifications. Just them. Just you. Full connection.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Notice how rich this feels. This is what presence offers. This is what the phone steals.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

From now on, when you are with people, you will be with people. The phone goes away. Not on the table, tempting you. Away.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You will make eye contact. You will listen fully. You will be there, not half there. The people in your life deserve your presence.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The memories you want are not of screens. They are of faces, laughter, connection. Build memories of presence, not distraction.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When you feel the pull of the phone while with people, press your clarity anchor. Remember what matters. Choose connection over distraction.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Rest in presence now. The people in your life are more valuable than any notification. Remember this. Live this.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

It is time to return. As I count from one to ten, you will become alert, carrying presence with you.

One... beginning to return.
Two... feeling connected and present.
Three... becoming more aware.
Four... refreshed and relationship-focused.
Five... halfway back.
Six... alertness increasing.
Seven... feeling wonderful.
Eight... almost there.
Nine... nearly fully awake.
Ten... eyes open, fully alert. Be present with your people, Austin. They are the treasure.
