=== PRE-TALK / SETTLING (2-3 minutes) ===

Welcome back, Austin. In previous sessions, you gained understanding of phone addiction, developed awareness and boundaries, rewired your dopamine system, identified your voids, and learned mindful technology use. Today, we address something the phone has been stealing: real human connection.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When you are with people you love, but your attention is on your phone, you are not really with them. You are half-present. Your body is there, but your mind is elsewhere. This divided attention has a cost, and the people around you pay it.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The phone promises connection. Social media, messaging, video calls. But there is a difference between digital interaction and true presence. When you are scrolling while sitting next to your spouse, you are choosing a screen over a human. When you check notifications while your child is talking, you teach them they are interruptible.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Today, we explore the difference between connection and distraction. You will learn to choose presence over screens. The people in your life deserve your full attention. And you deserve the depth of relationship that only presence can provide.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Put your phone far away now. Find your comfortable position. True connection is about to become your priority.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== INDUCTION - Eye Fatigue and Diaphragmatic Breathing (10-12 minutes) ===

Before we close your eyes, find a spot above your natural line of sight. Perhaps on the ceiling, perhaps high on the wall ahead. Focus your eyes on that spot now.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Notice how this upward gaze begins to tire your eye muscles. Let the tiredness come. It is the gateway to deep relational awareness.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

As you maintain this gaze, begin your diaphragmatic breathing. Belly breathing... when you breathe in, your belly expands outward. When you breathe out, your belly button sinks back toward your spine.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Breathe in deeply through your nose... let your belly rise... hold for a moment... and release slowly through your mouth. This breathing opens your heart to the people who matter most.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

Take another deep belly breath. Your eyes still focused upward... becoming heavier... more tired with each moment. Breathe in... belly expanding... hold... and release, feeling your capacity for presence growing.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

One more breath. And as you exhale this time, allow your eyes to close. Let them fall shut with relief. Feel yourself entering a state of deep connection with what matters.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Now imagine your neck has become like a bundle of loose rubber bands. All tension dissolving. Your head floating gently... like a helium balloon... supported without any effort.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Allow your jaws to sag. Let your mouth open slightly. Your tongue resting loosely. Complete facial relaxation.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let your shoulders sag completely. Shoulders dropping... dropping... as low as they can go.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

Your arms and hands becoming limp, loose, and heavy. So limp, so loose, so heavy with relaxation... like heavy lead weights. So heavy it would take too much effort to lift them.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

Your legs and feet now. Let them go limp, loose, and heavy. Complete surrender to relaxation. Complete letting go.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

The better you feel, the deeper you go. And the deeper you go, the better you feel. A beautiful spiral of deepening peace and opening heart.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Your eyelids now... so relaxed they've become wonderfully heavy. As though gently stuck together. This heaviness is connection. This heaviness is presence.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

=== DEEPENING (8-10 minutes) ===

Now let's go deeper. Imagine yourself descending into the heart of what matters most: the people in your life who love you and whom you love.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Twenty steps will take you to this heart of connection. With each step, your appreciation for real relationship grows.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Twenty. You take the first step. The faces of loved ones beginning to appear.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Nineteen. Another step. Relationships coming into focus.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Eighteen. Deeper now. The people who matter becoming clearer.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Seventeen. Digital noise fading away.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Sixteen. Going deeper. Human connection taking priority.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Fifteen. Halfway there. Presence becoming more important.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Fourteen. Deeper and deeper with each step.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Thirteen. Your heart opening to those who love you.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Twelve. Real relationships mattering more than screens.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Eleven. Your subconscious mind opening to presence.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Ten. Ready for deep connection training.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Nine. Almost there. The people in your life becoming vivid.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Eight. So deep now. So aware of what matters.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Seven. The heart of connection ahead.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Six. Just a few more steps.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Five. Profound peace. Profound appreciation.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Four. Ready for relational transformation.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Three. Almost there.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Two. One more step.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

One. You stand in the heart of connection. Here, people matter more than devices. Here, presence is everything.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

=== THERAPEUTIC CONTENT (15-18 minutes) ===

--- What the Phone Is Stealing ---

Austin, let us be honest about what phone addiction has cost you in relationships.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Think of moments when someone was talking to you, and your eyes drifted to the phone. What message did that send? That the phone is more interesting than they are. That whatever notification might arrive is more important than what they are saying.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Think of meals where the phone sat on the table, a third presence demanding attention. Even when you did not look at it, its presence changed the dynamic. The potential for interruption hovered over every conversation.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Think of times you half-listened while scrolling, making sounds of acknowledgment while your mind was elsewhere. The person speaking to you could tell. They always can. Half-attention is insulting, even when unintentional.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Think of experiences you documented for social media instead of experiencing fully. Concerts watched through a screen. Meals photographed before eaten. Moments turned into content instead of being lived.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

--- The Cost to Children ---

If you have children, or interact with children, they are particularly affected by phone distraction.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Children are remarkably observant. They notice where your attention goes. When you choose the phone over them, they learn that they are less interesting than a screen. They learn that they are interruptible. They learn that partial attention is normal.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Research shows that children of phone-distracted parents have more behavioral problems, struggle more for attention, and feel less secure in attachment. They literally act out because acting out is the only way to compete with the phone.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

What children need is not perfect parents. They need present parents. Parents who look them in the eye. Parents who put down the phone when they speak. Parents who demonstrate through attention that their children matter.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Austin, what messages about their worth have the children in your life received from your phone use? This is not about guilt. It is about awareness and the decision to do differently starting now.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

--- The Cost to Marriage and Partnership ---

Romantic relationships also suffer from phone distraction.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Couples who frequently use phones in each other's presence report less satisfaction and less trust. The phone introduces a rival for attention, and the rival never sleeps, never takes a break, always has something new to offer.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Intimacy requires presence. You cannot connect deeply while checking notifications. You cannot truly listen while scrolling. The vulnerability that relationships require is undermined by the constant escape route the phone provides.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Many couples exist in the same room while being in entirely different worlds. Side by side on the couch, each absorbed in their own screen. This is not togetherness. This is parallel isolation.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

What would it mean to give your full presence to your spouse or partner? To put the phone away and be completely there? To listen without checking, to talk without glancing, to connect without competing with a screen?

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

--- The Savior's Example of Presence ---

Consider how the Savior interacted with people. The scriptures record many conversations, and in each one, He was fully present.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

When He spoke with the woman at the well, He gave her His full attention despite cultural prohibitions. When He blessed the children, He did not rush through it to get to something more important. When He wept at the tomb of Lazarus, He was fully present to grief.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Even when crowds pressed around Him, He could focus on the one. The woman who touched His garment received His full attention. Zacchaeus in the tree received His full attention. The blind man by the road received His full attention.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

This kind of presence is a form of love. When you give someone your undivided attention, you communicate that they have worth. You communicate that this moment matters. You communicate that they are not interruptible.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

--- Choosing Connection Over Distraction ---

Let us establish practical ways to choose connection over distraction.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

First, designate phone-free zones in your relationships. When you are at meals together, phones go away. Not on the table where they can buzz and flash. Away. Out of sight.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Second, designate phone-free times. The first minutes when you reunite after being apart should be phone-free. Greetings should happen face to face, not over a screen.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Third, when someone is talking to you, give them your eyes. Put down the phone. Turn toward them. Look at their face. This simple act communicates respect and love.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Fourth, resist the urge to document everything. Some moments are meant to be lived, not captured. The experience of watching a sunset together is diminished when one person is taking photos instead of watching.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Fifth, practice presence during activities. When playing with children, play fully. When walking with your spouse, walk together fully. Let the phone stay in your pocket.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

--- The Gift of Full Attention ---

Austin, full attention is one of the greatest gifts you can give another person.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

When someone receives your full attention, they feel valued. They feel that their words matter. They feel that you care about what they are experiencing. This is nourishment for relationships.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Full attention is rare in our distracted age. Most people are used to competing with screens for attention. When you give someone complete presence, it stands out. It is remembered. It strengthens the bond between you.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Think of someone who has given you full attention. How did it feel? That feeling is what you can give to others by choosing presence over distraction.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

--- Strengthening the Anchor ---

Press your thumb and pinky finger together now.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Feel clarity, awareness, boundaries, neural healing, void understanding, and mindful use flowing in from previous sessions. Now add to them: the commitment to true connection. The choice of presence over distraction. The gift of full attention.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Hold the pressure. When you feel the phone pulling at you while you are with people, press thumb to pinky. Remember what matters. The people in front of you are more important than any notification.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Your anchor now carries seven elements: clarity, awareness, boundaries, neural healing, void understanding, mindful use, and presence with people. Together they create deep, lasting change.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Release. The anchor is reinforced.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

--- Practicing Presence Now ---

Let us practice presence in your imagination.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Think of someone you love. See their face clearly. Their eyes. Their expression. The unique way they look at you.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Imagine they are speaking to you. Something important to them. Perhaps about their day, perhaps about a concern, perhaps about a hope or dream.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Give them your full attention. Your eyes on their face. Your mind following their words. Your heart open to what they are sharing. No phone. No glances elsewhere. Just them. Just you. Full connection.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Notice how this feels. There is richness here. Depth. The warmth of real relationship. This is what presence offers. This is what distraction steals.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

You can have this in your daily life. It requires only the choice to put down the phone and be fully present.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

--- Future Pacing ---

See yourself in the coming days. You are with family. Instead of the phone on the table, it is away. You look at faces. You listen to voices. You are truly there.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Your children speak, and you give them your eyes. They feel your full attention. They learn that they matter. The bond strengthens.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Your spouse shares something, and you listen without glancing at a screen. They feel heard. They feel valued. The relationship deepens.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

A week from now, presence is becoming your norm when you are with people. The phone stays away during connection time. Relationships are improving.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

A month from now, Austin, people in your life notice the difference. They may not name it, but they feel it. You are more present. You are more connected. You are more there.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The memories you are building are not of screens. They are of faces, laughter, conversations, moments fully lived. These are the treasures that last.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

=== POST-HYPNOTIC SUGGESTIONS (2-3 minutes) ===

The commitment to presence continues to strengthen. When you are with people, you choose connection over distraction.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your phone goes away during family time, during meals, during conversations. Not on the table. Away.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When someone speaks to you, you give them your eyes. Your attention. Your presence. This is love in action.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You resist the urge to check, to scroll, to glance. The people in front of you are more valuable than any notification. You know this. You live this.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Relationships deepen. Connections strengthen. Real moments replace digital distraction.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== EMERGENCE (3-5 minutes) ===

It's time now to return to full waking consciousness. But you take with you the heart of connection. People matter more than phones.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

As I count from one to ten, you'll become gradually more alert, more awake, more refreshed... and deeply committed to presence.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One. Beginning to return. The people you love held close in your heart.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Two. Becoming aware of your body... so relaxed... so at peace.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Three. Feeling connected. Feeling present. Feeling ready to show up fully.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Four. Energy beginning to return. Mind sharp and relationally aware.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Five. Halfway back. The commitment to presence now solid.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Six. More alert now. Fingers and toes may begin to move.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Seven. Feeling wonderful. Feeling grateful for the people in your life.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Eight. Almost there. Taking a deep, refreshing breath.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Nine. Ready to open your eyes, ready to be fully present.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Ten. Eyes open, fully awake, completely alert, and committed to real connection.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Welcome back, Austin. The people in your life are treasures. They deserve your full presence. When you are with them, be with them.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The phone can wait. The moment in front of you cannot. Choose connection over distraction. This is how you build relationships that last. This is how you live a life that matters.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Be present. Be there. Be with your people.
