[BEGIN SCRIPT]

Welcome back, Austin. Today we rewire your brain. Phone addiction hijacks your dopamine system. You will reclaim your natural reward pathways.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Put your phone out of sight. Take a deep breath in... hold... and release, beginning the reset.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Another breath, deeper... allowing your brain to recalibrate... hold... and release.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One more breath... eyes closing, reward system beginning to heal.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let the golden light of healing rebalance dopamine. Head to toe. Neural pathways resetting.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Descend now. Ten to one. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Complete healing.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Phone use floods dopamine unnaturally. Every notification releases a hit. Your brain adapts by reducing sensitivity. You need more stimulation to feel satisfied.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This is why real life feels boring. Your dopamine system is dysregulated. But your brain can heal. Reduce artificial stimulation, and sensitivity returns.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

See neural pathways for phone notifications dimming. See pathways for natural pleasures brightening. Conversation. Nature. Completing tasks.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your brain is plastic. Less phone, different brain. This is neuroscience.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Seek natural rewards. A walk. A conversation. A hobby. A meal without screens. These will feel less stimulating at first. Sensitivity returns with time.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The scripture speaks of being renewed in the spirit of your mind. Your brain is literally renewing.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When restless without the phone, breathe through it. Press your clarity anchor. The urge passes.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One... beginning to return.
Two... feeling balanced and clear.
Three... becoming alert.
Four... refreshed and healing.
Five... eyes open, fully alert. Your brain is rewiring, Austin. Keep healing.
