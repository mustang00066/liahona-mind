[BEGIN SCRIPT]

Welcome back, Austin. Today we explore what you miss when the phone captures your attention. The people in front of you. The moments passing by.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Put your phone far away. Take a deep breath in... hold... and release, becoming fully present.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Another breath, deeper... feeling what it means to be completely here... hold... and release.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One more breath... eyes closing, heart opening to real relationships.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let the golden light of presence connect you to what is real. Head to toe. People coming into focus.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Descend now. Ten to one. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Complete connection.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Consider what you have missed. Conversations half-heard. Time with spouse half-present. Gatherings watched through a camera instead of your eyes.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The phone promises connection but delivers the opposite. You scroll highlight reels while missing your own life.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Children notice where your eyes go. They learn what matters. What does the phone teach them about their importance?

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The Savior was fully present. When He spoke with someone, He was there completely.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Presence is the greatest gift. Full attention says: You matter. Nothing is more important than you right now.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Imagine someone you love. Give them full attention. Not glancing at a phone. Just them. Just you. Full connection.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This is what presence offers. This is what the phone steals.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When with people, be with people. Phone goes away. Make eye contact. Listen fully. Be there.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One... beginning to return.
Two... feeling connected and present.
Three... becoming alert.
Four... refreshed and relationship-focused.
Five... eyes open, fully alert. Be present with your people, Austin.
