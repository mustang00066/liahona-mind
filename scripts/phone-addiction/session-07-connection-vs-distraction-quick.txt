=== PRE-TALK / SETTLING (1-2 minutes) ===

Welcome back, Austin. Today we address what the phone has been stealing: real human connection. When you are with people you love but your attention is on the phone, you are not really there. Half-present is not enough.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

The phone promises connection but often delivers the opposite. Scrolling while sitting next to your spouse. Checking notifications while your child speaks. These habits have costs, and the people around you pay them.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Put your phone far away. Find your comfortable position. Presence with people is about to become your priority.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== INDUCTION - Rapid Relaxation (5-6 minutes) ===

Take a deep diaphragmatic breath. Belly breathing... belly expands in, sinks down out.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Breathe in through your nose... belly rising... and release. Feel your heart opening to the people who matter.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Another breath... and as you exhale, allow your eyes to close.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let your neck become loose like rubber bands. Head floating. Jaws sagging. Complete facial relaxation.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Arms and hands becoming limp, loose, and heavy. Like lead weights. Legs and feet the same.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The better you feel, the deeper you go. The deeper you go, the better you feel.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your eyelids so relaxed they've become gently stuck together. This heaviness is connection. This heaviness is presence.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== DEEPENING (3-4 minutes) ===

Imagine descending into the heart of what matters: the people who love you and whom you love. Ten steps down.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Ten. Faces of loved ones appearing.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Nine. Relationships coming into focus.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Eight. Digital noise fading.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Seven. Human connection taking priority.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Six. Presence becoming important.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Five. Heart opening.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Four. Real relationships mattering.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Three. Ready for connection.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Two. Almost there.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

One. You stand in the heart of connection. People matter more than devices.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== THERAPEUTIC CONTENT (8-10 minutes) ===

Receive only what serves you. Your subconscious mind will accept what is true for you and let the rest go.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

--- What the Phone Is Stealing ---

Austin, consider what phone addiction has cost you in relationships. Moments when someone was talking and your eyes drifted to the screen. Meals where the phone sat on the table, demanding potential attention. Times you half-listened while scrolling.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The people speaking to you could tell. They always can. Half-attention is insulting, even when unintentional.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

--- The Cost to Children ---

Children are particularly affected. They notice where your attention goes. When you choose the phone over them, they learn they are less interesting than a screen. They learn they are interruptible.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

What children need is not perfect parents. They need present parents. Parents who look them in the eye. Parents who put down the phone when they speak.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

--- The Cost to Relationships ---

Romantic relationships also suffer. Couples who frequently use phones in each other's presence report less satisfaction. The phone introduces a rival that never sleeps.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Intimacy requires presence. You cannot connect deeply while checking notifications. Many couples exist in the same room while being in different worlds.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

--- The Savior's Example ---

The Savior was fully present with people. When He spoke with the woman at the well, she had His full attention. When He blessed children, He did not rush. Even when crowds pressed, He could focus on the one.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This kind of presence is love. When you give someone full attention, you communicate that they have worth. That this moment matters. That they are not interruptible.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

--- Choosing Connection ---

Practical steps: Designate phone-free zones. Meals together mean phones away. Not on the table. Away.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

When someone talks to you, give them your eyes. Put down the phone. Turn toward them. This communicates respect.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Resist documenting everything. Some moments are meant to be lived, not captured.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

--- Strengthening the Anchor ---

Press your thumb and pinky finger together now.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Feel clarity, awareness, boundaries, neural healing, void understanding, and mindful use flowing in. Now add: the commitment to presence with people. Connection over distraction.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

When you feel the phone pulling while with people, press thumb to pinky. Remember what matters. People are more important than notifications.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Release. The anchor now carries seven elements including presence with people.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

--- Practicing Presence ---

Think of someone you love. See their face. Imagine they are speaking to you about something important.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Give them full attention. Eyes on their face. Mind following their words. No phone. Just them. Just you. Full connection.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Notice the richness. The warmth of real relationship. This is what presence offers. This is what distraction steals.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

--- Future Pacing ---

See yourself with family. Phone away. You look at faces. You listen to voices. You are truly there.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

A week from now, presence is becoming your norm. A month from now, people notice the difference. Relationships are deepening.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== POST-HYPNOTIC SUGGESTIONS (1 minute) ===

When you are with people, you choose connection. Phone goes away during family time, meals, conversations.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

When someone speaks, you give them your eyes. This is love in action.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

People are more valuable than notifications. You know this. You live this.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== EMERGENCE (2-3 minutes) ===

Time to return. The heart of connection stays with you.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

One. Beginning to return. People you love held close.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Two. Becoming aware of your body. Relaxed and at peace.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Three. Feeling connected. Present. Ready to show up.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Four. Energy returning. Mind sharp.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Five. Eyes open, fully awake, committed to presence.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Welcome back, Austin. The people in your life are treasures. They deserve your full presence. When you are with them, be with them. The phone can wait. The moment cannot. Choose connection over distraction.
