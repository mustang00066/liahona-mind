=== PRE-TALK / SETTLING (1-2 minutes) ===

Welcome back, Austin. Today we build awareness. Understanding when and why you reach for your phone gives you power over the pattern.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

A trigger is anything that prompts you to check your phone. It could be an emotion, a situation, or pure habit. Without awareness, the reach is automatic. With awareness, you have choice.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Put your phone aside. Find your comfortable position. Awareness is about to become your ally.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== INDUCTION - Rapid Relaxation (5-6 minutes) ===

Take a deep diaphragmatic breath. Belly breathing... belly expands in, sinks down out.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Breathe in through your nose... belly rising... and release. Feel your mind entering a state of heightened observation.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Another breath... and as you exhale, allow your eyes to close.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let your neck become loose like rubber bands. Head floating. Jaws sagging. Complete facial relaxation.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Arms and hands becoming limp, loose, and heavy. Like lead weights. Legs and feet the same.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The better you feel, the deeper you go. The deeper you go, the better you feel.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your eyelids so relaxed they've become gently stuck together. This heaviness is awareness. This heaviness is seeing clearly.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== DEEPENING (3-4 minutes) ===

Imagine an observation room where you can watch your patterns. Ten steps to enter.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Ten. Your observer mind awakening.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Nine. Patterns beginning to emerge.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Eight. Automatic behaviors becoming visible.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Seven. Your triggers coming into focus.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Six. Clarity increasing.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Five. Deeper awareness.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Four. No judgment. Only curiosity.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Three. Ready for insight.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Two. Almost there.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

One. You stand in the observation room. From here, you can see your triggers clearly.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== THERAPEUTIC CONTENT (8-10 minutes) ===

--- Types of Triggers ---

Triggers fall into four categories: emotional, environmental, social, and habitual.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Emotional triggers are powerful. Boredom makes the phone appear. Anxiety seeks distraction. Loneliness reaches for false connection. Stress wants escape.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Environmental triggers are situations and locations. The bedroom. Waiting in line. The couch at night. Time of day. These cue automatic checking.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Social triggers involve others. Fear of missing out. The pressure to respond immediately. Awkwardness in groups. Seeing others on their phones.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Habitual triggers are pure reflex. The hand reaches without thought. Certain actions pair with phone use. Eating means scrolling. Lying down means checking.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

--- Your Personal Triggers ---

Austin, watch your typical day unfold in your mind. When do you reach for the phone? What triggers the reach?

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Notice what you feel before checking. Boredom? Anxiety? Nothing at all? These feelings are clues.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Notice the situations. When and where does the urge arise? These patterns are valuable data.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

--- The Space Between Trigger and Response ---

Here is the key: between trigger and response, there is a space. In that space lies your freedom.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When you notice a trigger, name it. Boredom trigger. Anxiety trigger. This naming creates distance. You observe rather than react.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

After naming, pause. Press thumb to pinky. Ask: what do I actually need? Often the phone cannot provide it.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The goal is conscious choosing, not perfect abstinence. Over time, you will choose differently more often.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

--- Scripture Insight ---

The Savior taught, Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation. This watching is awareness.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Temptation is not sin. The trigger is not the problem. It is the unconscious response. Watch the trigger, and you can respond differently.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

--- Strengthening the Anchor ---

Press your thumb and pinky finger together now.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Feel clarity from Session One flowing in. Now add awareness of triggers. The ability to see the urge before acting.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

When you notice a trigger, press thumb to pinky. The automatic reach pauses. You have a choice.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Release. The anchor now carries two elements: clarity and awareness.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

--- Future Pacing ---

See yourself tomorrow. A trigger arises. You notice it. You name it. You press your anchor. The pause extends. You choose consciously.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

A week from now, you catch yourself more often. The space between trigger and response is growing.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

A month from now, you know your triggers well. The unconscious has become conscious.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== POST-HYPNOTIC SUGGESTIONS (1 minute) ===

Your awareness continues to sharpen. When a trigger arises, you recognize and name it.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Your anchor is always available. Between trigger and response, your freedom grows.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== EMERGENCE (2-3 minutes) ===

Time to return. The observation room stays with you.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

One. Beginning to return. The observer self remains.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Two. Becoming aware of your body. Relaxed and at peace.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Three. Feeling aware. Observant. Conscious.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Four. Energy returning. Mind sharp and watchful.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Five. Eyes open, fully awake, newly aware.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Welcome back, Austin. Practice watching in the coming days. Notice triggers. Name them. Pause. Ask what you actually need. This transforms unconscious habit into conscious choice. Freedom lives in the space between trigger and response.
