Duration: ~28 minutes
Voice: Male, British accent, calm and insightful

[BEGIN SCRIPT]

Welcome back, Austin. Today we build awareness. Understanding when and why you reach for your phone is key to change.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Put your phone aside. Take a deep breath in... hold... and release.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Another breath, deeper... preparing to see patterns... hold... and release.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One more breath... eyes closing, mind becoming observant.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let the golden light illuminate habits. Head to toe. Automatic behaviors becoming visible.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Descend now. Ten to one. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Complete awareness.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When do you reach for your phone? First check in bed before you rise. Throughout the day—waiting, boredom, anxiety. The pull is automatic.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Emotional triggers: loneliness, boredom, stress. The phone offers escape. It numbs without solving.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Environmental triggers: certain places, times. The couch at night. Any moment of stillness.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Think of your patterns. What emotions typically precede phone use? What situations? What times?

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Awareness of triggers is half the battle. When you recognize I am checking my phone because I am bored, you have a choice.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The pause between trigger and action is where freedom lives. Notice the urge without acting immediately.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The scripture teaches, Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation. Watching your triggers is defense.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Before picking up the phone, pause and ask: Why am I reaching for this? What do I actually need?

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Press your clarity anchor when you notice a trigger. Thumb to pinky. The automatic reach pauses.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One... beginning to return.
Two... feeling observant and conscious.
Three... becoming alert.
Four... refreshed and mindful.
Five... eyes open, fully alert. Watch your triggers, Austin. Awareness is power.
