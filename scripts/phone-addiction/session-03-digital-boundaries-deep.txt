=== PRE-TALK / SETTLING (2-3 minutes) ===

Welcome back, Austin. In our previous sessions, you gained understanding of phone addiction and developed awareness of your triggers. Today, we take practical action: establishing digital boundaries.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Without boundaries, the phone will consume everything you offer it. Your time, your attention, your sleep, your relationships. It will take whatever you give. The only limit is the one you set.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

With clear boundaries, you reclaim your life. You decide how much time the phone gets. You choose when and where it may intrude. You establish rules that protect what matters most.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Today, we will explore different types of boundaries, help you choose ones that fit your life, and install them deeply in your subconscious so they feel natural to maintain.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Put your phone somewhere you cannot see it. Find your comfortable position. Digital boundaries are about to become your shield.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== INDUCTION - Eye Fatigue and Diaphragmatic Breathing (10-12 minutes) ===

Before we close your eyes, find a spot above your natural line of sight. Perhaps on the ceiling, perhaps high on the wall ahead. Focus your eyes on that spot now.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Notice how this upward gaze begins to tire your eye muscles. Let the tiredness come. It is the gateway to building firm, protective boundaries.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

As you maintain this gaze, begin your diaphragmatic breathing. Belly breathing... when you breathe in, your belly expands outward. When you breathe out, your belly button sinks back toward your spine.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Breathe in deeply through your nose... let your belly rise... hold for a moment... and release slowly through your mouth. This breathing builds the calm resolve you need for boundary-setting.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

Take another deep belly breath. Your eyes still focused upward... becoming heavier... more tired with each moment. Breathe in... belly expanding... hold... and release, feeling your determination strengthen.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

One more breath. And as you exhale this time, allow your eyes to close. Let them fall shut with relief. Feel yourself entering a state where boundaries can be firmly established.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Now imagine your neck has become like a bundle of loose rubber bands. All tension dissolving. Your head floating gently... like a helium balloon... supported without any effort.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Allow your jaws to sag. Let your mouth open slightly. Your tongue resting loosely. Complete facial relaxation.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let your shoulders sag completely. Shoulders dropping... dropping... as low as they can go.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

Your arms and hands becoming limp, loose, and heavy. So limp, so loose, so heavy with relaxation... like heavy lead weights. So heavy it would take too much effort to lift them.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

Your legs and feet now. Let them go limp, loose, and heavy. Complete surrender to relaxation. Complete letting go.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

The better you feel, the deeper you go. And the deeper you go, the better you feel. A beautiful spiral of deepening peace and strengthening resolve.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Your eyelids now... so relaxed they've become wonderfully heavy. As though gently stuck together. This heaviness is protection. This heaviness is boundary.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

=== DEEPENING (8-10 minutes) ===

Now let's go deeper. Imagine yourself building a fence around a beautiful garden. The garden is your life: your time, your attention, your relationships, your peace. The fence is your digital boundaries.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Twenty steps will take you to the center of this garden, where you will design your fence with care and intention.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Twenty. You take the first step. The garden is yours to protect.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Nineteen. Another step. Boundaries beginning to form.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Eighteen. Deeper now. Your resolve strengthening.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Seventeen. What belongs inside the fence becoming clear.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Sixteen. Going deeper. What must stay outside becoming clear.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Fifteen. Halfway there. Your right to boundaries established.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Fourteen. Deeper and deeper with each step.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Thirteen. The phone cannot cross limits you set.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Twelve. Your life is yours to protect.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Eleven. Your subconscious mind opening wide.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Ten. Ready to establish firm boundaries.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Nine. Almost there. Discipline building.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Eight. So deep now. So resolved.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Seven. The center of your garden ahead.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Six. Just a few more steps.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Five. Profound peace. Profound protection.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Four. Ready for boundary installation.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Three. Almost there.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Two. One more step.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

One. You stand in the center of your garden. From here, you will design and build the boundaries that protect your life.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

=== THERAPEUTIC CONTENT (15-18 minutes) ===

You remain in complete control. Your deeper mind will accept only the suggestions that align with your values and serve your growth. Everything else simply fades away.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

--- Why Boundaries Matter ---

Austin, let us first understand why digital boundaries are essential. Without them, you have no defense against a device engineered to capture your attention without limit.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The phone is always available. Unlike other activities that have natural endpoints, the phone has infinite content, infinite scroll, infinite claims on your time. The only endpoint is the one you create.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Boundaries transform the phone from master to servant. You decide when it may have your attention, not the other way around. You choose how long, not the algorithms.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Boundaries also protect what matters. Time spent on the phone is time not spent elsewhere. If you value family, sleep, work, hobbies, prayer, boundaries protect these from digital encroachment.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

--- Types of Boundaries ---

Let us explore the different types of digital boundaries you might establish.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Time boundaries limit how much total time you spend on the phone, or on specific apps. Perhaps you decide on one hour of recreational screen time per day. Perhaps certain apps get fifteen minutes each. You choose the limits.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Screen-free times protect certain hours of the day. The first hour after waking... reserved for presence, for prayer, for family, not for checking the phone. The last hour before bed... reserved for winding down without blue light and stimulation. Mealtimes... reserved for eating and connection.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Place boundaries designate certain locations as phone-free. The bedroom can be a sanctuary for sleep and intimacy. The dining table can be for meals and conversation. The bathroom need not be another scrolling opportunity.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Notification boundaries control what is allowed to interrupt you. Turn off notifications for social media, for games, for anything that does not require immediate attention. You decide when to check, not the app.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

App boundaries address specific applications. Which apps truly serve you? Which ones consume you without benefit? You can delete, restrict, or move problematic apps to make compulsive use harder.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

--- Choosing Your Boundaries ---

Austin, what boundaries would serve you best? Let us explore this together.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Consider your morning. What if the phone stayed in another room, charging, while you began your day? What if the first hour belonged to you, to your family, to quiet? How might your mornings feel different?

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Consider mealtimes. What if the phone never appeared at the table? What if meals were for eating, for conversation, for presence? How might your relationships feel different?

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Consider evenings. What if the phone went to its charging place one hour before bed? What if that hour was for reading, for relaxation, for winding down without screens? How might your sleep feel different?

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Consider total time. What is a reasonable amount of recreational phone use per day? Be honest but not harsh. What feels both challenging and achievable?

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Consider notifications. Which ones truly need to reach you immediately? Which ones can wait until you choose to check? Turn off everything that does not need instant attention.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Consider apps. Which ones genuinely serve your life? Which ones primarily consume your time? Can you delete, restrict, or move the problematic ones?

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

--- Installing Your Boundaries ---

Let us now install these boundaries deeply. See yourself implementing each one.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Morning boundary: See yourself waking. Your phone is in another room, charging. You rise and begin your day without checking. You are present. You have time for prayer, for family, for a peaceful start. This is your new normal.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Mealtime boundary: See yourself at the table. No phone in sight. You eat mindfully. You talk with those present. You notice the food. The meal ends naturally, without scrolling. This is how you eat now.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Evening boundary: See yourself in the evening. At your chosen time, the phone goes to its charging place. The bedroom is phone-free. Your last hour is calm, screen-free. Sleep comes more easily. This is your new routine.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Time boundary: See yourself checking your phone's screen time feature. You have set a limit. When you approach it, you notice. When you reach it, you stop. This limit protects your life.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Notification boundary: See your phone, quiet. No constant buzzing, no frequent alerts. Most notifications are off. When you check, you choose to check. Nothing interrupts uninvited. You control the flow of information.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

These boundaries are now part of who you are. They are not restrictions imposed from outside. They are protections you have chosen for yourself.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

--- The Scripture Example ---

The Savior modeled boundaries throughout His ministry. Though all sought Him, though the needs were endless, He withdrew regularly to pray. He said no to demands that did not serve His mission. He slept when He needed rest.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

If the Son of God required boundaries, so do you. You are not required to be constantly available. You are not obligated to respond immediately to every notification. You have the right to protect your time and attention.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The scriptures teach that to everything there is a season. There is a time for connection and a time for solitude. A time to engage and a time to withdraw. Boundaries honor these seasons.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

--- When Boundaries Feel Hard ---

Boundaries will feel uncomfortable at first. You may feel restless, anxious, worried about what you are missing. This discomfort is temporary. Push through it.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The discomfort is withdrawal. Your brain is accustomed to constant stimulation. When the stimulation stops, it protests. But each time you honor a boundary despite discomfort, you grow stronger.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Use your anchor when boundaries feel hard. Press thumb to pinky. Feel clarity return. Remember why you set these boundaries. Remember what you are protecting.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The freedom that comes from boundaries far outweighs the temporary discomfort of establishing them. On the other side of the discomfort is a life reclaimed.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

--- Strengthening the Anchor ---

Press your thumb and pinky finger together now.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Feel clarity and awareness flowing in from previous sessions. Now add to them: the resolve of digital boundaries. The protection of limits. The freedom of saying no to the phone.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Hold the pressure. When you are tempted to violate a boundary, press thumb to pinky. Clarity returns. Resolution strengthens. The boundary holds.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Your anchor now carries three elements: clarity about phone addiction, awareness of triggers, and the protective power of boundaries. Together they give you strength.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Release. The anchor is reinforced.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

--- Future Pacing ---

See yourself tomorrow morning. You wake, and the phone is in its charging place, not beside you. You begin your day without checking. You feel present, peaceful, free. The morning boundary holds.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

At dinner, no phone appears. You eat, you connect, you notice. The mealtime boundary holds.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

In the evening, the phone goes to its place. Your last hour is screen-free. You wind down naturally. Sleep comes easier. The evening boundary holds.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

A week from now, boundaries have become routine. The discomfort has lessened. You have more time, more presence, more peace. The boundaries are working.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

A month from now, boundaries feel natural. You barely remember what it was like to have the phone always available. Life is fuller. The phone serves you, not the other way around.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

=== POST-HYPNOTIC SUGGESTIONS (2-3 minutes) ===

The boundaries you have established today become part of your daily life. Each day, they grow stronger and more natural.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When the urge to violate a boundary arises, you pause. You press your anchor. You remember why you set this limit. The boundary holds.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Temporary discomfort does not override your boundaries. You feel the restlessness and act anyway. Freedom awaits on the other side.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your phone serves you now. It operates within the limits you have set. Your time, your attention, your life belong to you.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== EMERGENCE (3-5 minutes) ===

It's time now to return to full waking consciousness. But you take with you the garden and its fence. Your boundaries remain intact.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

As I count from one to ten, you'll become gradually more alert, more awake, more refreshed... and more committed to your digital boundaries.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One. Beginning to return. The garden remains with you.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Two. Becoming aware of your body... so relaxed... so at peace.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Three. Feeling boundaried. Feeling protected. Feeling free.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Four. Energy beginning to return. Mind sharp and resolved.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Five. Halfway back. Your limits firmly established.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Six. More alert now. Fingers and toes may begin to move.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Seven. Feeling wonderful. Feeling disciplined. Feeling powerful.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Eight. Almost there. Taking a deep, refreshing breath.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Nine. Ready to open your eyes, ready to honor your boundaries.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Ten. Eyes open, fully awake, completely alert, and digitally boundaried.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Welcome back, Austin. Take a moment to feel this resolve... the clarity of knowing your limits, the power of choosing what the phone gets and what it does not.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Begin implementing your boundaries today. Start small if needed, but start. Each boundary honored strengthens your freedom. Each limit maintained reclaims your life.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Your garden is protected now. Honor your fence. Your time, your attention, your life are yours to guard.
