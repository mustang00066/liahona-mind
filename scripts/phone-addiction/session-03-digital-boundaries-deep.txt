Duration: ~38 minutes
Voice: Male, British accent, calm and insightful

[BEGIN SCRIPT]

Welcome back, Austin. Today we establish boundaries. Without limits, the phone will take everything. With boundaries, you reclaim your time and attention.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Put your phone somewhere you cannot see it. Take a deep breath in... hold gently... and release, feeling your space clear.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Another breath, deeper... preparing to establish limits... hold... and release, determination building.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

One more breath... breathing in discipline... hold... and as you exhale, let your eyes close and your resolve strengthen.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let the golden light of boundaries begin at your head. This light creates protective limits. Scalp warming. The endless scroll no longer acceptable.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The warmth flows through your body, creating a shield. The phone's demands will hit this shield. Your attention stays yours.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Now the staircase. Twenty steps down to firm boundaries.

Twenty, nineteen, eighteen, seventeen, sixteen... limits forming.
Fifteen, fourteen, thirteen, twelve, eleven... resolve strengthening.
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six... discipline deepening.
Five, four, three, two, one... complete boundaries achieved.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

You are in a place of clear limits. Here, you decide how much the phone gets. Not the other way around.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Boundaries require decision. You must choose your limits consciously. Let us explore what boundaries might serve you.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

First, time boundaries. Consider a daily limit for recreational phone use. One hour? Two? What feels both challenging and possible?

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Consider screen-free times. The first hour after waking. Meals. One hour before bed. These times belong to life, not the phone.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Second, place boundaries. Certain spaces can be phone-free. The bedroom. The dinner table. The bathroom. When you enter these spaces, the phone stays outside.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Third, notification boundaries. Not every app deserves to interrupt you. Turn off notifications for anything non-essential. You decide when to check, not the app.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Fourth, app boundaries. Some apps are more addictive than others. Consider which apps truly serve you and which just consume you. Remove or limit the latter.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The Savior withdrew regularly from demands to pray, to rest. He modeled boundaries. Even divine mission required limits on availability.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let us program your boundaries now. See yourself waking in the morning. Your phone stays charging in another room. The first hour belongs to you—to prayer, to family, to presence.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

See yourself at meals. Phone nowhere in sight. Full attention on food, on companions, on the moment.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

See yourself in the evening. One hour before bed, the phone goes to its charging place. Your bedroom is for sleep and intimacy, not scrolling.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

These boundaries will feel difficult at first. You may feel restless, wondering what you are missing. This discomfort is temporary. The freedom is lasting.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

From now on, you will honor your boundaries. When the urge to violate them arises, you will press your clarity anchor and remember why you set them.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Boundaries are not punishment. They are protection. They protect your time, your attention, your relationships, your sleep. They protect the life you want to live.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Tell others about your boundaries if it helps. I do not check my phone during dinner. I am not available after ten. Speaking boundaries makes them more real.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Rest in your bounded space now. You have limits. You have discipline. The phone serves you, not the other way around.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

It is time to return. As I count from one to ten, you will become alert, carrying your boundaries with you.

One... beginning to return.
Two... feeling boundaried and free.
Three... becoming more aware.
Four... refreshed and disciplined.
Five... halfway back.
Six... alertness increasing.
Seven... feeling wonderful.
Eight... almost there.
Nine... nearly fully awake.
Ten... eyes open, fully alert. Your boundaries are set, Austin. Honor them.
