=== PRE-TALK / SETTLING (1-2 minutes) ===

Welcome back, Austin. Today we focus on prevention—guarding your heart and mind against unnecessary exposure.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

The best way to manage lustful thoughts is to reduce how often they arise. This means being intentional about what you expose yourself to.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

"Keep thy heart with all diligence, for out of it are the issues of life."

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== INDUCTION - Rapid Relaxation with Breathing (5-6 minutes) ===

Take a deep breath now. Diaphragmatic breathing—belly expanding as you breathe in, sinking as you breathe out.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Breathe in through your nose... belly rising gently... hold for a moment... and release. You will be intentional about what enters your mind.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Another breath... deeper... and as you exhale, allow your eyes to close naturally.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let your neck become loose like rubber bands. Head floating. Jaws sagging. Shoulders dropping.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Arms becoming limp, loose, and heavy. All the way down to your hands.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Legs and feet the same. The better you feel, the deeper you go. Boundaries forming.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Your eyelids becoming wonderfully heavy. As though gently stuck together. Ready to guard.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== DEEPENING (3-4 minutes) ===

Imagine yourself at the top of a staircase... ten steps leading down to a place of wise protection.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Ten. Stepping down. Protection developing.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Nine. Deeper. Mind focused.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Eight. Ready for boundaries.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Seven. Deeper still.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Six. Halfway there.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Five. So focused. So intentional.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Four. Almost there.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Three. Deep wisdom.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Two. One more step.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

One. You enter a place of wise protection. Here you can design boundaries that guard your heart. Everything you learn will be absorbed completely.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== THERAPEUTIC CONTENT (8-10 minutes) ===

--- Know Your Triggers ---

To guard effectively, you must know what you are guarding against.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Triggers vary: visual media, social media, certain websites, environments, loneliness, boredom, stress. What tends to initiate lustful thoughts for you?

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Knowing your triggers is strategic awareness, not dwelling on them.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- The Eye Gate ---

Much of lust enters through the eyes. What you look at matters.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Job made a covenant with his eyes. Practice the "bounce"—briefly notice, then deliberately look elsewhere. No staring. No second looks.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Be intentional about visual media. Avoid content designed to provoke lust. Your eyes are a gate to your heart.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Digital Boundaries ---

The internet provides unlimited access to triggering content. Boundaries are essential.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Use content filters. Delete triggering apps. Limit provocative social media. Keep devices in public areas. Consider accountability software.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

These are not signs of weakness. They are signs of wisdom.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Filling the Void ---

Lust often arises when there is a void—boredom, loneliness, stress.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Instead of lustful fantasy when bored, have engaging activities ready. Instead of sexual content when lonely, reach out to someone. Instead of escapism when stressed, exercise or pray.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When you fill the voids, lust has less room to enter.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- The Heart Behind the Eyes ---

Guarding is not just external. It is about cultivating a pure heart.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Fill your heart with good things. Scripture. Prayer. Gratitude. Love for God and family. When your heart is full, there is less room for lust.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

"Whatever things are pure, whatever things are lovely... think on these things."

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Anchor Reinforcement ---

Touch the center of your forehead, reinforcing your purity anchor.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

This anchor carries your commitment to guard your heart and mind. You access wisdom to protect what enters.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Say internally: "I guard my heart. I protect my eyes. My heart is worth protecting."

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Release your hand.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== POST-HYPNOTIC SUGGESTIONS (1 minute) ===

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== EMERGENCE (2-3 minutes) ===

It is time to return to full awareness, bringing your commitment to guard with you.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

I will count from one to five. With each number, you become more alert while protection strengthens.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

One. Beginning to return. Boundaries installed.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Two. Energy returning. Eyes guarded.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]
