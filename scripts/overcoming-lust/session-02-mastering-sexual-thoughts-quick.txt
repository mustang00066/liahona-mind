=== PRE-TALK / SETTLING (1-2 minutes) ===

Welcome back, Austin. Today we develop the core skill: mastering your sexual thoughts.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Thoughts arise unbidden. What happens next IS your choice. You can dwell on the thought or notice it, release it, and redirect your attention.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let us develop this crucial ability.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== INDUCTION - Rapid Relaxation with Breathing (5-6 minutes) ===

Take a deep breath now. Diaphragmatic breathing—belly expanding as you breathe in, sinking as you breathe out.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Breathe in through your nose... belly rising gently... hold for a moment... and release. Your mind is trainable.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Another breath... deeper... and as you exhale, allow your eyes to close naturally.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let your neck become loose like rubber bands. Head floating. Jaws sagging. Shoulders dropping.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Arms becoming limp, loose, and heavy. All the way down to your hands.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Legs and feet the same. The better you feel, the deeper you go. Control developing.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Your eyelids becoming wonderfully heavy. As though gently stuck together. Ready for mastery.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== DEEPENING (3-4 minutes) ===

Imagine yourself at the top of a staircase... ten steps leading down to a place of mental mastery.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Ten. Stepping down. Control developing.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Nine. Deeper. Mind focused.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Eight. Ready for skill.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Seven. Deeper still.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Six. Halfway there.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Five. So focused. So controlled.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Four. Almost there.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Three. Deep mastery.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Two. One more step.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

One. You enter a place of mental mastery. Here you can train your mind at will. Everything you learn will be absorbed completely.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== THERAPEUTIC CONTENT (8-10 minutes) ===

Receive only what serves you. Your subconscious mind will accept what is true for you and let the rest go.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

--- The Two Moments ---

The first moment is the arising—a thought appears unbidden. Not your choice.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The second moment is your response. This is where mastery lives.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Notice-Release-Redirect ---

NOTICE: As soon as you're aware of a lustful thought, label it. "There is a lustful thought." This creates distance.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

RELEASE: Let it pass like a cloud. Don't grab it. Don't fight it. Let it float through.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

REDIRECT: Move your attention to something else—a task, a memory, a prayer.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

With practice, this becomes automatic.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Early Interception ---

The earlier you catch a thought, the easier to redirect. In the first second, it's a small spark. After minutes of fantasy, it's a bonfire.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Catch thoughts early. Notice quickly. Release immediately.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Redirect Options ---

Physical: Move your body. Mental: Count backwards, recall a memory. Spiritual: Prayer or scripture. Task: Engage in focused work.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Have several options ready.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Anchor Reinforcement ---

Touch the center of your forehead, reinforcing your anchor.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

This anchor carries Notice-Release-Redirect. You access thought mastery.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Say internally: "I notice, release, redirect. I am master of my thoughts."

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Release your hand.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== POST-HYPNOTIC SUGGESTIONS (1 minute) ===

When lustful thoughts arise, you will catch them early. Notice. Release. Redirect.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

You will have redirect destinations ready. You will release, not fight.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your anchor supports this mastery.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== EMERGENCE (2-3 minutes) ===

It is time to return to full awareness, bringing thought mastery with you.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

I will count from one to five. With each number, you become more alert while mastery strengthens.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

One. Beginning to return. Mastery installed.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Two. Energy returning. Notice. Release. Redirect.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Three. Early interception ready.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Four. Almost fully alert. Master of thoughts.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Five. Eyes open, fully awake, completely alert, and skilled at thought mastery.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Welcome back, Austin. Practice Notice-Release-Redirect this week. Your mind is yours to direct.
