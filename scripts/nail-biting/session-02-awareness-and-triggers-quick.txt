Duration: ~28 minutes
Voice: Male, British accent, calm and warm

[BEGIN SCRIPT]

Welcome back, Austin. Find your comfortable position. You are continuing your journey toward freedom.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Take a deep breath in... and release slowly. With this breath, release any stress.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Another breath, deeper... body relaxing.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One more breath... eyes closing, entering peace.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let relaxation flow from head to toe. Scalp, face, jaw softening. Neck, shoulders releasing. Arms, hands deeply relaxed. Chest, stomach, back, legs, feet. Your entire body at peace.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Descend now. Ten to one. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Deep hypnosis.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Austin, today we deepen awareness of triggers. Understanding triggers gives you power over them.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Common triggers: Stress and anxiety—hands seeking something to do. Boredom—the mind not engaged. Concentration—deep focus. Physical—a rough edge. Emotional—strong feelings.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let your subconscious identify which triggers are most relevant for you.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Whatever your triggers, they are becoming visible. Awareness illuminates what was hidden.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Develop your early warning system. The habit follows: trigger, urge, hand movement, biting. The earlier you notice, the easier to interrupt.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

What does the urge feel like? A restless feeling? A thought about your nails? From now on, your sensitivity increases. A gentle alert: urge arising.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This is urge surfing. The urge is a wave. Ride it out without acting, and it passes.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Create an awareness anchor. When you tap your wrist twice, you instantly become aware of your hands. Practice now. Tap, awareness sharpens.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You are becoming the observer, the one who chooses. Progress, not perfection.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One... beginning to return.
Two... energy flowing.
Three... refreshed.
Four... becoming aware.
Five... eyes open, fully alert. Notice your triggers today, Austin.
