=== PRE-TALK / SETTLING (1-2 minutes) ===

Welcome back, Austin. Find your comfortable position. You are continuing your journey toward freedom from nail biting.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Today we go deeper into awareness. You will learn to recognize your triggers, develop an early warning system, and install the wrist tap—a powerful awareness tool from Habit Reversal Training.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Research shows that simply becoming aware of when and why you bite significantly reduces the behavior. Today, awareness becomes your superpower.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== INDUCTION - Rapid Relaxation with Breathing (5-6 minutes) ===

Take a deep diaphragmatic breath now. Belly breathing... when you breathe in, your belly expands. When you breathe out, it sinks down.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Breathe in through your nose... let your belly rise... hold gently... and release through your mouth. With each exhale, awareness sharpens.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Another breath... deeper... and as you exhale, allow your eyes to close naturally.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let your neck become loose like rubber bands. Your head floating like a helium balloon. Jaws sagging. Shoulders dropping completely.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Arms becoming limp, loose, and heavy. Like lead weights. Especially your hands, Austin—notice them even as they relax.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Legs and feet the same. So limp, so loose, so heavy with relaxation.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The better you feel, the deeper you go. The more aware you become.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your eyelids now... so relaxed they've become wonderfully heavy. As though gently stuck together. This heaviness is awareness deepening.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== DEEPENING (3-4 minutes) ===

Imagine yourself at the top of a staircase... ten steps leading down to a sanctuary of profound awareness.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Ten. Stepping down. Awareness sharpening.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Nine. Deeper. Beginning to see patterns.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Eight. Hidden things becoming visible.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Seven. So aware. So perceptive.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Six. Halfway there. Clarity growing.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Five. Triggers becoming visible.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Four. Nothing hidden from your awareness.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Three. Almost there.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Two. One more step.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

One. You step into complete awareness.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

You can now see the patterns of your behavior with perfect clarity.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

=== THERAPEUTIC CONTENT (8-10 minutes) ===

Receive only what serves you. Your subconscious mind will accept what is true for you and let the rest go.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

--- Understanding Triggers ---

Austin, every instance of nail biting begins with a trigger. When you know your triggers, you can anticipate and prepare.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The first category is emotional triggers. Stress and anxiety are common—hands seeking something to do. But also frustration, boredom, and even excitement.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Which emotions have triggered your nail biting? Notice.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The second category is situational triggers. Watching television. Working at the computer. Riding in a car. Where are you most likely to bite?

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The third category is physical triggers. A rough edge on a nail. The urge to "fix" it—but biting makes it worse.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The fourth is cognitive triggers. Perfectionism: "I need to fix this nail." Self-criticism. Mindless wandering.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- The Early Warning System ---

Awareness is most powerful when it comes early. The habit follows: trigger, urge, hand moves, biting. The earlier you notice, the more power you have.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

What does an urge feel like before it fully forms? A restless feeling in the fingers. A thought about the nails. The beginning of hand movement.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your sensitivity to these early signs now increases. A gentle internal alert: "Urge arising."

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- The Wrist Tap ---

Now let us install the wrist tap. Whenever you notice your hand moving toward your mouth, immediately tap your opposite wrist twice.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This accomplishes several things. It interrupts the pattern. It brings attention to the present moment. It creates a pause where you can choose differently.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Imagine yourself during your day. Hand drifts toward mouth. Immediately, you tap your wrist. Awareness floods in. You have a choice.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The wrist tap is now installed. It will activate automatically.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

--- Urge Surfing ---

An urge is like a wave. It builds, peaks, and subsides. If you ride it out without acting, the urge passes. Most urges fade within two to three minutes.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When you feel an urge, notice it without judgment. Watch it build, peak, and fade. You are the observer, not the actor.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Direct Suggestions ---

Listen now as your subconscious receives these suggestions.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

From this day forward, your awareness of triggers increases dramatically. You recognize the situations, emotions, and sensations that activate urges.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your awareness of triggers increases. This happens automatically.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your early warning system is now active. You notice before the bite happens.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The wrist tap is installed. Whenever your hand moves toward your mouth, you tap your wrist. Instant awareness.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Reinforcing the Anchor ---

Press your thumb and first finger together now.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Add trigger recognition. Thumb and first finger means: I am aware. I notice my hands. I recognize my triggers. I have early warning.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Release. The anchor is strengthened.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

--- Future Pacing ---

See yourself tomorrow... urge arises... you notice immediately... tap wrist... awareness floods in... urge passes. A week from now... awareness sharp and consistent. A month from now... patterns documented, strategies in place, nails healing.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== POST-HYPNOTIC SUGGESTIONS (1 minute) ===

These changes are taking root. Each wrist tap strengthens the pattern. Each surfed urge weakens the old habit.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

The truth shall make you free. The truth about your triggers is setting you free.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Remember: progress, not perfection. The Savior values your effort.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== EMERGENCE (2-3 minutes) ===

It's time to return to full awareness, bringing this sharpened awareness with you.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

I'll count from one to five. With each number, you become more alert while keeping your awareness.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

One. Beginning to return. Awareness coming with you.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Two. More aware of your body. Fingers and toes moving slightly.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Three. Energy returning. The wrist tap ready.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Four. Almost fully alert. Feeling aware.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Five. Eyes open, fully awake, completely alert, and deeply aware.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Welcome back, Austin. You now know your triggers. You have an early warning system. The wrist tap is your ally.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Practice the wrist tap whenever you notice your hand moving toward your mouth. Each tap strengthens the pattern.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Notice your triggers today. Use your awareness. You are making excellent progress.
