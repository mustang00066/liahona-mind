NAIL BITING - SESSION 3: The Competing Response (DEEP VERSION)
Duration: ~38 minutes
Voice: Male, British accent, calm and warm

[BEGIN SCRIPT]

Welcome back, Austin. Find your comfortable position. Today you learn a powerful technique: the competing response. This gives your hands something else to do when urges arise.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Take a deep breath in... and release slowly.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Another breath, deeper... body relaxing.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

One more breath... eyes closing, entering peace.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let the golden light of relaxation flow from head to toe. Scalp, face, jaw softening. Neck, shoulders releasing completely. Arms, hands deeply relaxed.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Chest, stomach, back releasing. Hips, legs, feet. Complete peace.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Now, the staircase. Twenty steps down to the deepest change.

Twenty, nineteen, eighteen, seventeen, sixteen... going deeper.
Fifteen, fourteen, thirteen, twelve, eleven... letting go.
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six... subconscious opening.
Five, four, three, two, one... deep hypnosis achieved.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

the competing response is the heart of Habit Reversal Training. When an urge arises, you replace the unwanted behavior with an incompatible action. Your hands cannot bite nails while doing something else.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your competing response is making a gentle fist. When you notice an urge, you simply make a soft fist and hold it for two minutes. This gives the urge time to pass.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let us program this now. See yourself in a triggering situation. The urge arises. You notice it. Immediately, your hands gently form fists. Softly held, not tense.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Hold the fists while the urge peaks and fades. Two minutes. The urge passes. Your hands relax. You have won.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Practice now in your imagination. Feel the urge. Make the fists. Hold. Wait. The urge fades. Release.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

This response becomes automatic. Urge equals fist. No thought required. Your hands know what to do.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The scripture teaches that we should resist temptation and it will flee. The competing response is physical resistance. The urge cannot survive when your hands are occupied.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Imagine using this throughout your day. At your desk, you feel an urge. Your hands form gentle fists. You continue working. The urge passes. Victory.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Watching television, the urge arises. Gentle fists. Wait. The urge fades. Victory.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

In conversation, the urge appears. Hands in soft fists at your sides. No one notices. The urge passes. Victory.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Each time you use the competing response, you strengthen the new pattern and weaken the old. Your brain rewires. The automatic reach for your mouth transforms into the automatic fist.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Combined with your awareness anchor—the wrist tap—you now have a complete system. Tap to become aware. Fist to respond. Urge passes. Freedom grows.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

commit now to using this response. Every time an urge arises, gentle fists. Two minutes or until the urge passes. No exceptions for the first weeks.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The consistency is what creates change. Not perfection—consistency. Miss sometimes? Return to the practice. Each use strengthens the habit.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Rest in this programming. Urge equals fist. This is your new automatic response.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

As I count from one to ten, you will return to full waking consciousness.

One... beginning to return.
Two... energy flowing.
Three... refreshed.
Four... becoming aware.
Five... halfway back.
Six... alertness increasing.
Seven... feeling wonderful.
Eight... almost there.
Nine... nearly awake.
Ten... eyes open, fully alert. Use the competing response today, Austin.
