[BEGIN SCRIPT]

Welcome, Austin. Find a comfortable position. Allow your body to settle into stillness. This is your time for healing.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

By choosing to address this habit, you are taking an important step. Our bodies are temples, sacred gifts from our Heavenly Father.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Take a deep breath in... filling your lungs completely... and exhale slowly, releasing tension.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Another breath in... peace and calm... and release, shoulders softening.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One more breath... eyes closing, relaxing completely.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let golden light begin at your head. Relaxation spreading down. Face softening. Jaw releasing. Neck, shoulders dropping.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Arms relaxing. Your hands, which will soon be free from this habit, completely at peace.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Relaxation continuing through chest, stomach, back, legs, feet. Your entire body deeply relaxed.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Now descend. Ten to one. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Deep hypnosis, where transformation happens easily.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

nail biting is a body-focused repetitive behavior. Not a character flaw. Simply a pattern your mind learned as a way to cope.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

What the subconscious has learned, it can unlearn. The Savior taught that the truth shall make you free. Understanding habits is part of that truth.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Habits have a trigger, routine, and reward. In coming sessions, we address each part.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Right now, develop awareness. Observe yourself. Notice when your hands move toward your face. What triggers this? Stress? Boredom?

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Notice early signs the urge is building. The earlier you notice, the easier to redirect. Awareness creates choice.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your hands are valuable. Instruments for good. They deserve care.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Imagine your hands in the future. Healthy, strong nails. Hands you feel proud of. This image is planted deep in your subconscious.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

With God all things are possible. Including overcoming this habit. You will be free.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One... beginning to return.
Two... refreshed.
Three... mind clear.
Four... becoming aware.
Five... eyes open, fully alert. You are on your path to freedom, Austin.
