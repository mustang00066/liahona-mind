NAIL BITING - SESSION 5: Building New Identity (QUICK VERSION)
Duration: ~28 minutes
Voice: Male, British accent, calm and warm

[BEGIN SCRIPT]

Welcome back, Austin. Today we build your new identity. You are becoming someone who does not bite their nails. This is identity change, not just behavior change.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Take a deep breath in... and release slowly.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Another breath, deeper... preparing to see yourself anew.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One more breath... eyes closing, entering transformation.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let the light of change flow through you. Head to toe. Becoming the new you.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Descend now. Ten to one. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Deep hypnosis.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Austin, the most powerful change happens at the identity level. When you see yourself as someone who does not bite, behavior follows naturally.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Someone with healthy nails does not struggle to avoid biting. They simply do not bite. It is not in their identity. You are becoming that person.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

See yourself in the future. Strong, healthy nails. Hands you are proud of. This is who you are now.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

How does this person think? They do not think about nail biting. It is not an option.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

How do they feel? Confident. Free. Proud.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

How do they act? Hands relaxed, away from mouth. Using a file for rough edges.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The scripture teaches that through Christ we become new creatures. This habit is passing away. You are being made new.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Repeat silently: I am someone who does not bite my nails.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Again: I am someone who does not bite my nails.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

This is becoming truth. Each moment you do not bite, it becomes more true.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When urges arise, they are echoes of the old identity. The new you lets them pass.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One... beginning to return.
Two... carrying your new identity.
Three... refreshed.
Four... becoming alert.
Five... eyes open, fully alert. You are someone who does not bite their nails, Austin.
