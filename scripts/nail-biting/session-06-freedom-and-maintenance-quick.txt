[BEGIN SCRIPT]

Welcome back, Austin. This is our final nail biting session. Today we solidify freedom and establish maintenance practices.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Take a deep breath in... and release slowly.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Another breath, deeper... celebrating how far you have come.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One more breath... eyes closing, entering lasting freedom.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let the light of completion flow through you. Head to toe. Every change becoming permanent.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Descend now. Ten to one. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Deep hypnosis.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Austin, you have done remarkable work. You have awareness, competing response, emotional understanding, and new identity. Freedom is yours.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Review your tools: Awareness anchor—tap wrist twice. Competing response—gentle fists. Emotional awareness—name feelings. New identity—I am someone who does not bite.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

These tools work together. Use them all.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

For maintenance, care for your nails properly. Keep them trimmed. Use a file for rough edges. Monitor stress levels.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The scripture says, Be not weary in well doing. Stay vigilant. The harvest is certain if you persist.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

If a slip happens, do not despair. Learn and move forward. The Savior offers unlimited grace.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

See your hands. Strong, healthy nails. Hands you are proud of. This is who you are.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The neural pathways of the old habit are weakening. Freedom is strengthening.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Return to these sessions when needed. Use daily boosters. Your freedom is maintained by practice.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One... beginning to return.
Two... carrying lasting freedom.
Three... refreshed.
Four... becoming alert.
Five... eyes open, fully alert. You are free, Austin. Go in peace.
