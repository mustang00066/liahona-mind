NAIL BITING - SESSION 3: The Competing Response (QUICK VERSION)
Duration: ~28 minutes
Voice: Male, British accent, calm and warm

[BEGIN SCRIPT]

Welcome back, Austin. Today you learn a powerful technique: the competing response. This gives your hands something else to do when urges arise.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Take a deep breath in... and release slowly.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Another breath, deeper... body relaxing.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One more breath... eyes closing, entering peace.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let relaxation flow from head to toe. Face, jaw softening. Shoulders releasing. Arms, hands at peace. Complete relaxation.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Descend now. Ten to one. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Deep hypnosis.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The competing response is the heart of habit reversal. When an urge arises, you replace the behavior with an incompatible action.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your competing response is making a gentle fist. When you notice an urge, make a soft fist and hold for two minutes. The urge passes.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

See yourself in a trigger situation. The urge arises. Your hands form gentle fists. Hold. The urge peaks and fades. Release. Victory.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Practice now. Feel the urge. Make the fists. Hold. Wait. The urge fades. Release.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This becomes automatic. Urge equals fist. No thought required.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The scripture teaches to resist temptation and it will flee. The competing response is physical resistance.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Throughout your day: at your desk, watching television, in conversation. Urge arises. Gentle fists. Urge passes. Victory.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Combined with your awareness anchor, you have a complete system. Tap to become aware. Fist to respond. Urge passes.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Commit now. Every urge, gentle fists. Consistency creates change.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One... beginning to return.
Two... energy flowing.
Three... refreshed.
Four... becoming aware.
Five... eyes open, fully alert. Use the competing response today, Austin.
