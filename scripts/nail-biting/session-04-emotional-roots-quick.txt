[BEGIN SCRIPT]

Welcome back, Austin. Today we explore the emotional roots of nail biting. By addressing the feelings beneath the habit, we create lasting freedom.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Take a deep breath in... and release slowly.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Another breath, deeper... allowing yourself to feel safe.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One more breath... eyes closing, entering emotional healing.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let healing light flow through you. Head to toe. Softening, releasing, peaceful.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Descend now. Ten to one. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Deep hypnosis.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Austin, habits often serve an emotional purpose. Nail biting may help manage feelings that feel too big to face.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

What feelings connect to your habit? Anxiety—calming nervous energy. Boredom—filling empty moments. Frustration—a safe release. Sadness—comfort.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let your subconscious reveal which emotions connect. Without judgment, simply notice.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Whatever the emotion, it is valid. You learned to cope through this habit. Now you can learn better ways.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The Savior said, Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden. Bring difficult feelings to Him rather than numbing them.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You can feel anxious and not bite. Feel bored and not bite. Feel frustrated, sad, lonely, and keep your hands away.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Healthier responses: When anxious, take deep breaths. When bored, move. When frustrated, clench and release fists. When sad, reach out.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

See yourself facing a difficult emotion. Pause. Breathe. Let the feeling exist. It passes without destroying you.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

From now on, notice emotions beneath urges. Name them. Let them pass without the habit.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You can face your feelings. They are temporary. The habit is no longer needed.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One... beginning to return.
Two... emotionally aware.
Three... refreshed.
Four... becoming alert.
Five... eyes open, fully alert. Face your feelings, Austin. You are strong enough.
