Duration: ~38 minutes
Voice: Male, British accent, calm and warm

[BEGIN SCRIPT]

Welcome back, Austin. Today we explore the emotional roots of nail biting. By addressing the feelings beneath the habit, we create lasting freedom.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Take a deep breath in... and release slowly.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Another breath, deeper... allowing yourself to feel safe.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

One more breath... eyes closing, entering a space of emotional healing.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let the golden light of healing flow through you. Head to toe. Every part of you softening, releasing, becoming peaceful.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Now, the staircase. Twenty steps down to the deepest understanding.

Twenty, nineteen, eighteen, seventeen, sixteen... going deeper.
Fifteen, fourteen, thirteen, twelve, eleven... defenses softening.
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six... heart opening.
Five, four, three, two, one... deep hypnosis achieved.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

habits often serve an emotional purpose. Nail biting may help you manage feelings that feel too big to face directly.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

What feelings does the habit manage? For some, it is anxiety—the repetitive motion calms nervous energy. For others, boredom—the stimulation fills an empty moment.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Some use it to manage frustration or anger—a safe release when other expressions feel dangerous. Others use it for comfort during sadness or loneliness.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let your subconscious reveal which emotions connect to your habit. Without judgment, simply notice what arises.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Whatever the emotion, it is valid. You learned to cope with it through this habit. That was wisdom at the time. Now you can learn better ways.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The Savior said, Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. He invites us to bring our difficult feelings to Him rather than numbing them with habits.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You can feel anxious and not bite. You can feel bored and not bite. You can feel frustrated, sad, lonely, and still keep your hands away from your mouth.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The feeling will not destroy you. It will rise, peak, and fall—like all feelings. You can ride it out.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let us install healthier responses to difficult emotions. When you feel anxious, you can take three deep breaths. When bored, you can move your body. When frustrated, you can clench and release your fists. When sad, you can reach out to another person.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

See yourself now facing a difficult emotion. The feeling arises. Old patterns want you to bite. But you pause. You breathe. You let the feeling exist.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The feeling passes without destroying you. You are stronger than you knew. The habit was never needed as much as you thought.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

From now on, you will notice the emotions beneath urges. You will name them: I feel anxious right now. Then you will let them pass without the habit.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This is emotional maturity. Feeling feelings without needing to do something about them immediately. Sitting with discomfort. Growing through it.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your Heavenly Father is with you in these difficult feelings. He does not ask you to numb them. He asks you to bring them to Him.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Rest in this understanding. You can face your feelings. They are temporary. The habit is no longer needed.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

As I count from one to ten, return to full waking consciousness.

One... beginning to return.
Two... emotionally aware.
Three... refreshed.
Four... becoming alert.
Five... halfway back.
Six... alertness increasing.
Seven... feeling wonderful.
Eight... almost there.
Nine... nearly awake.
Ten... eyes open, fully alert. Face your feelings, Austin. You are strong enough.
