=== PRE-TALK / SETTLING (2-3 minutes) ===

Welcome back, Austin. Find your comfortable position and allow yourself to settle in. You are continuing your journey toward freedom from nail biting.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

In our first session, you began to understand this habit—what it is, how it works, and why it developed. Today we go deeper into awareness. You will learn to recognize your specific triggers, develop an early warning system, and install a powerful awareness tool called the wrist tap.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Awareness is the foundation of Habit Reversal Training, the most effective evidence-based approach for body-focused repetitive behaviors like nail biting. Research shows that simply becoming aware of when and why you engage in the behavior significantly reduces its occurrence—even before you actively try to stop.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Today, awareness becomes your superpower. Let us begin.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== INDUCTION - Eye Fatigue and Diaphragmatic Breathing (10-12 minutes) ===

Before we close your eyes, find a spot above your natural line of sight. Perhaps on the ceiling... or high on the wall ahead. Focus your eyes on that spot now.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Notice how this upward gaze begins to tire your eye muscles. As your eyes fatigue, your awareness naturally begins to sharpen. You are becoming more attuned to your body.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

As you hold this gaze, begin your diaphragmatic breathing. Belly breathing... when you breathe in, your belly expands. When you breathe out, your belly button sinks toward your spine.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Breathe in deeply through your nose... let your belly rise... hold for a moment... and release slowly through your mouth. With each exhale, your awareness increases.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

This breathing stimulates your vagus nerve, bringing calm alertness. The perfect state for learning—relaxed yet aware.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Take another deep belly breath. Your eyes still focused upward... heavier... more tired. Breathe in... belly expanding... hold... and release. You are entering a state of heightened awareness.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

One more breath. And as you exhale this time, allow your eyes to close. Let them fall shut with relief. You are entering a deeply receptive state.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Good. Now imagine your neck becoming like a bundle of loose rubber bands. All tension dissolving. Your head floating gently... like a helium balloon.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Allow your jaws to sag. Your mouth opening slightly. Your tongue resting loosely. The forehead smoothing out completely.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let your shoulders sag completely. Shoulders dropping... dropping... as low as they can go.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

Your arms becoming limp, loose, and heavy. So limp, so loose, so heavy. And especially your hands, Austin. These hands that are learning new patterns. Feel them completely relaxed. Notice them. Be aware of them even in relaxation.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

Your legs and feet now. Let them go limp, loose, and heavy.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

The better you feel, the deeper you go. The deeper you go, the better you feel. And the more aware you become.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

It feels so good to just relax. It feels so good to just breathe. It feels so good to become more aware.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Your eyelids now... so relaxed they've become wonderfully heavy. As though gently stuck together. This heaviness is awareness deepening.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

From head to toe, you are deeply relaxed. Your body is at peace. Your awareness is sharpening. You are ready to learn.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== DEEPENING (8-10 minutes) ===

Now, imagine yourself at the top of a staircase. This staircase leads down to a sanctuary of profound awareness... a place where you can see clearly what was once hidden.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

There are twenty steps. With each step, your awareness increases. By the bottom, you will see your triggers with crystal clarity.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step twenty. You place your foot on the first step. Already awareness is sharpening.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Nineteen. Another step down. Your sensitivity increasing.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Eighteen. Deeper now. Beginning to see patterns.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Seventeen. Going deeper. Awareness growing.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Sixteen. Hidden things becoming visible.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Fifteen. Past the surface. Into clarity.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Fourteen. Deeper and deeper. Clearer and clearer.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Thirteen. So aware. So perceptive. So ready to see.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Twelve. The sanctuary of awareness coming into view.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Eleven. Your subconscious opening to full awareness.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Ten. Halfway there. Halfway to complete clarity.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Nine. Every trigger becoming visible.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Eight. Deeper. More aware. Seeing clearly.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Seven. Almost there. The sanctuary waiting.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Six. Profound awareness. Profound clarity.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Five. So deep now. So ready to learn.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Four. Nothing is hidden from your awareness here.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Three. The final steps.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Two. One more step.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

One. You step into the sanctuary of complete awareness.

[PAUSE 8 SECONDS]

You are now in a place of crystal clear awareness. From here, you can see the patterns of your behavior with perfect clarity. Triggers that were once invisible now stand out plainly. This is where real understanding happens.

[PAUSE 8 SECONDS]

=== THERAPEUTIC CONTENT (15-18 minutes) ===

--- Understanding Triggers ---

Austin, every instance of nail biting begins with a trigger. The trigger is like a button that starts the sequence. When you know your triggers, you can anticipate the urge and prepare to respond differently.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Triggers come in several categories. Let us explore each, and notice which resonate most strongly for you.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The first category is emotional triggers. Stress and anxiety are the most common. When we feel worried or overwhelmed, our hands may seek something to do. The repetitive motion of biting provides a temporary sense of control or soothing.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

But anxiety is not the only emotional trigger. Frustration can trigger biting—something goes wrong, and your hand goes to your mouth. Boredom can trigger it—the mind is not engaged, and the hands seek activity. Even excitement or anticipation can be triggers for some people.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Notice now: which emotions have triggered your nail biting in the past? Let your subconscious bring specific memories to mind.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

The second category is situational triggers. Certain environments or activities consistently activate the urge. Watching television is common—the hands are idle while the eyes are busy. Working at the computer. Riding in a car. Sitting in meetings or classes.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Notice: which situations have triggered your nail biting? Where are you most likely to bite? Let these situations become visible to you now.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

The third category is physical triggers. The most common is noticing a rough edge or imperfection on a nail. The urge arises to "fix" it—to bite it smooth. But biting usually makes things worse, creating more rough edges and continuing the cycle.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Other physical triggers include hunger, tiredness, or physical tension. The body seeks relief, and the habit provides a familiar outlet.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The fourth category is cognitive triggers—thought patterns that lead to biting. Perfectionism: "This nail isn't right, I need to fix it." Self-criticism: "I've already messed up, so why bother?" Mindless wandering: thoughts drift, and hands follow unconsciously.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

As you identify your personal triggers, you gain tremendous power. You can now predict when urges are likely to arise. You can prepare in advance. You can choose a different response.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

--- The Early Warning System ---

Awareness is most powerful when it comes early—before the bite happens, ideally before the hand even reaches the mouth.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The habit follows a sequence: trigger occurs, urge builds, hand moves, mouth opens, biting happens. If you notice at the biting stage, you've already lost. If you notice as your hand moves, you have a chance to redirect. If you notice when the urge first builds, you have maximum power to choose differently.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Your early warning system detects the earliest signs of an urge. What does an urge feel like before it fully forms? For most people, it includes some combination of these:

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

A restless feeling in the fingers or hands. A tingling or heightened awareness of the nails. A thought about the nails—noticing an edge, wondering about their appearance. A subtle movement of attention toward the hands. The beginning of the hand's movement toward the face.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

These early signs are unique to you. As I describe them, notice which ones you recognize from your own experience. Your subconscious is cataloging them now.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

From this day forward, your sensitivity to these early warning signs increases dramatically. They will register on your awareness like a gentle internal alert: "Urge arising." This alert gives you the gift of choice.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

--- The Wrist Tap ---

Now let us install a powerful awareness tool from Habit Reversal Training: the wrist tap.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The wrist tap is simple: whenever you notice your hand moving toward your mouth, or whenever you notice an urge arising, you immediately tap your opposite wrist twice with your other hand. Left wrist or right wrist—it doesn't matter. Just two gentle taps.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

This simple action accomplishes several important things at once.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

First, it interrupts the automatic pattern. The momentum toward biting is broken. Your hands are doing something different.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Second, it brings your attention fully to the present moment. You become consciously aware: I was about to bite. This awareness prevents the automatic, unconscious biting that happens so often.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Third, it creates a deliberate pause—a gap between trigger and response where you can choose what to do next. In that gap, you can use your competing response (which we'll learn in the next session), take a breath, or simply let the urge pass.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Fourth, the wrist tap serves as a record. Each time you tap, you're documenting an urge. This helps you see patterns—when urges are strongest, what triggers are most common.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let us install this tool now. Imagine yourself going about your day. You're at your desk, or watching TV, or in a meeting. Your hand begins to drift toward your mouth.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Immediately, you notice. You tap your wrist twice. Awareness floods in. You are fully present. You have a choice.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

See this happening in multiple scenarios. At home. At work. In the car. Each time, the hand begins to move—and immediately, the tap. Awareness. Choice. Power.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The wrist tap is now installed in your subconscious. It will activate automatically whenever your hand moves toward your mouth.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

--- Urge Surfing ---

Here is another powerful concept: urge surfing. An urge to bite is like a wave in the ocean. It builds, it peaks, and then it subsides. If you ride out the wave without acting on it, the urge passes naturally.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Many people believe that urges continue to build until they become irresistible. This is not true. Urges always pass. Research shows that most urges, left unacted upon, subside within two to three minutes. You can outlast any urge.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

When you feel an urge, notice it without judgment. "There is an urge." Don't fight it. Don't try to suppress it. Just observe it. Watch it build, watch it peak, watch it fade. You are the observer, not the actor.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Each time you successfully surf an urge—riding it out without biting—you weaken the habit. The neural pathway that connects trigger to behavior gets a little weaker. The new pathway—trigger to awareness to choice—gets a little stronger.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

--- Direct Suggestions ---

And now, as you rest in this deeply aware state, your subconscious mind is ready to receive powerful suggestions for awareness.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

From this day forward, your awareness of nail biting triggers increases dramatically. You recognize the situations, emotions, and sensations that activate the urge. Nothing is hidden anymore.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Your awareness of triggers increases. This happens automatically, without effort.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your early warning system is now active. You notice the earliest signs of an urge—the restless fingers, the thoughts about nails, the beginning of hand movement. You notice before the bite happens.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The wrist tap is installed. Whenever your hand moves toward your mouth, you immediately tap your wrist. This is automatic. This brings instant awareness.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

You understand urge surfing. Urges are waves that always pass. You can outlast any urge by simply observing it without acting.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

--- Reinforcing the Anchor ---

Press your thumb and first finger together now.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Your anchor from the first session carries awareness. Now add trigger recognition. Thumb and first finger together means: I am aware. I notice my hands. I recognize my triggers. I have early warning.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Hold the pressure. Feel awareness and recognition flowing into your fingers.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Release. The anchor is strengthened.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Future Pacing ---

See yourself tomorrow. Going about your normal activities. An urge begins to form. You notice it immediately—your early warning system at work. You tap your wrist. Awareness floods in. The urge peaks and fades. You have successfully surfed it.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

A week from now. Your awareness has become sharp and consistent. You know your triggers intimately. You catch urges early. The wrist tap has become second nature. Victory is becoming normal.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

A month from now. You've documented patterns in your urges. You know the high-risk times and situations. You're prepared for them. You have strategies. Your nails are healing because you're biting less and less.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

A year from now. Awareness of your hands is simply part of who you are. Not anxious vigilance—just calm presence. You've mastered this aspect of self-awareness, and it has improved your life in ways beyond just your nails.

[PAUSE 8 SECONDS]

=== POST-HYPNOTIC SUGGESTIONS (2-3 minutes) ===

As you rest in this aware state, your subconscious is integrating everything. These changes are taking root.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

In the days ahead, you will notice your triggers more clearly. This is not creating problems—it is illuminating what was already there. Awareness is power.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Each time you tap your wrist, you strengthen the pattern. Each time you surf an urge, you weaken the old habit. Progress is happening with every awareness.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The scripture teaches that the truth shall make you free. The truth about your triggers, the truth about your patterns—this truth is setting you free.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Remember: you are not trying to be perfect. Progress is enough. The Savior values your effort and your growth.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== EMERGENCE (3-5 minutes) ===

And now, Austin, it's time to return to full waking consciousness. The awareness you've developed here comes with you. Your early warning system is active. The wrist tap is installed.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

In a moment, I will count from one to ten. With each number, you'll become more alert, more awake, more refreshed... while keeping your heightened awareness.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One. Beginning to return. Awareness coming with you.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Two. Becoming more aware of your body. Your fingers and toes beginning to move.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Three. The room around you becoming more present. Your trigger recognition intact.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Four. More alert now. Energy returning to your body.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Five. Halfway back. Feeling wonderfully aware and alive.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Six. Your eyes may flutter. Your body preparing to return.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Seven. More and more alert. The wrist tap ready to serve you.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Eight. Almost there. Taking a deep, refreshing breath.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Nine. Ready to open your eyes and notice your triggers.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Ten. Eyes open, fully awake, completely alert, and deeply aware.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Welcome back, Austin. Take a moment to appreciate your increased awareness. You now know your triggers. You have an early warning system. The wrist tap is your ally.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

In the coming days, practice the wrist tap whenever you notice your hand moving toward your mouth—or even when you just think about biting. Each tap strengthens the pattern. Each tap brings freedom closer.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Notice your triggers today. Use your awareness. You are making excellent progress.
