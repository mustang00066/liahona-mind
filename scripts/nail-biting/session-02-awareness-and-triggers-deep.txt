[BEGIN SCRIPT]

Welcome back, Austin. Find your comfortable position and allow yourself to settle in. You are continuing your journey toward freedom.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Take a deep breath in now... and release it slowly. With this breath, you release any stress from your day.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Another breath in, deeper this time... and as you exhale, feel your body beginning to relax.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

One more breath... and let your eyes close as you exhale, entering this space of peace and transformation.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let the relaxation begin at the top of your head and flow downward like warm water. Feel it washing over your scalp, your forehead, relaxing the muscles around your eyes, your cheeks, your jaw.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This wave of relaxation continues down your neck, across your shoulders, releasing all tension. Down through your arms, into your hands. Your hands are especially relaxed now.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The relaxation spreads through your chest and stomach, your back, down through your hips and legs, all the way to your feet. Your entire body is now deeply relaxed.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Now, the staircase. Twenty steps down to the deepest awareness.

Step twenty... beginning your descent.
Step nineteen... going deeper.
Step eighteen... relaxation increasing.
Step seventeen... letting go.
Step sixteen... so peaceful.
Step fifteen... halfway there.
Step fourteen... deeper still.
Step thirteen... subconscious opening.
Step twelve... nothing matters but my voice.
Step eleven... deeper and deeper.
Step ten... profound peace.
Step nine... every suggestion received powerfully.
Step eight... going deeper.
Step seven... complete relaxation.
Step six... almost there.
Step five... so deep.
Step four... deeper than ever.
Step three... deepest peace.
Step two... one more step.
Step one... you are now in deep hypnosis.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Austin, today we deepen your awareness of the triggers that activate nail biting. Understanding your triggers gives you power over them.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

In Habit Reversal Training, this is called awareness training. Research shows that simply becoming aware significantly reduces habit occurrence.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let us explore common triggers. The first is stress and anxiety. When we feel worried, our hands may seek something to do. The repetitive motion can feel soothing in the moment.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Notice the situations in your life that create stress. Work deadlines. Difficult conversations. These may be times when your hands move toward your mouth.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The second trigger is boredom. When the mind is not engaged, the hands may seek activity. Watching television. Sitting in meetings. Waiting.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The third trigger is concentration. Deep focus can trigger nail biting. When absorbed in a task, your hands may bite without conscious awareness.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The fourth trigger is physical. A rough edge on a nail activates the urge to fix it. But biting makes it worse, continuing the cycle.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The fifth trigger is emotional. Frustration, disappointment, loneliness, even excitement can activate the habit.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Take a moment to let your subconscious identify which triggers are most relevant for you.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Whatever your triggers, they are now becoming visible. Awareness illuminates what was hidden. What is seen can be changed.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The scripture teaches, the truth shall make you free. This truth about your triggers is part of your freedom.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Now let us develop your early warning system. The habit follows a sequence: trigger, urge, hand movement, biting. The earlier you become aware, the easier to interrupt.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

What does the urge feel like? A restless feeling in your fingers? A thought about your nails? Your early warning signs are unique to you.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

From now on, your sensitivity to these signs increases dramatically. A gentle internal alert: urge arising.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This awareness does not create anxiety. It creates choice. I notice I have an urge. What shall I do instead?

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This is called urge surfing. The urge is like a wave. If you ride it out without acting, it will pass. Urges always pass.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Now, let us anchor this awareness. Whenever you gently tap your wrist twice, you will instantly become aware of your hands and any urges present.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Imagine tapping your wrist twice. As you do, awareness sharpens. You become conscious of your hands. This anchor is now installed in your subconscious.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

you are developing a new relationship with this habit. Instead of being controlled by it, you are becoming the observer, the one who chooses.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Remember, progress, not perfection. The Savior expects effort, growth, and reliance on Him. That is what you are offering.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let all of today's learning sink deep. The awareness is growing. The early warning system is installed.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

As I count from one to ten, you will return to full waking consciousness.

One... beginning to return.
Two... energy flowing.
Three... feeling refreshed.
Four... becoming aware.
Five... halfway back.
Six... alertness increasing.
Seven... feeling wonderful.
Eight... almost there.
Nine... nearly fully awake.
Ten... eyes open, fully alert. Notice your triggers today, Austin.
