Duration: ~38 minutes

[BEGIN SCRIPT]

Welcome back, Austin. This is our final nail biting session. Today we solidify your freedom and establish maintenance practices for lasting success.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Take a deep breath in... and release slowly.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Another breath, deeper... celebrating how far you have come.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

One more breath... eyes closing, entering lasting freedom.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let the golden light of completion flow through you. Head to toe. Every change becoming permanent.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Now, the staircase. Twenty steps down to lasting freedom.

Twenty, nineteen, eighteen, seventeen, sixteen... going deeper.
Fifteen, fourteen, thirteen, twelve, eleven... changes solidifying.
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six... freedom becoming permanent.
Five, four, three, two, one... deep hypnosis achieved.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

you have done remarkable work. You have built awareness, learned the competing response, addressed emotional roots, and created a new identity. Freedom is yours.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let us review your tools. Your awareness anchor—tap your wrist twice—brings instant consciousness of your hands. Use it in triggering situations.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your competing response—gentle fists held for two minutes—gives urges time to pass. Your hands cannot bite while occupied.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your emotional awareness lets you name feelings beneath urges. I feel anxious right now. Feelings pass without the habit.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your new identity—I am someone who does not bite my nails—makes the old behavior simply not an option.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

These tools work together. Use them all. They reinforce each other.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

For maintenance, continue caring for your nails properly. Keep them trimmed. Use a file for rough edges. Moisturize your cuticles. Healthy nails are easier to leave alone.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Monitor stress levels. When stress increases, old habits want to return. Use your techniques proactively during difficult times.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The scripture says, Be not weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not. Stay vigilant. The harvest is certain if you persist.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

If a slip happens—and it may—do not despair. A slip is not failure. It is information. What triggered it? What will you do differently? Learn and move forward.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The Savior offers unlimited grace. He does not expect perfection. He expects effort, growth, and reliance on Him. You are offering that.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

See your hands now. Strong, healthy nails. Hands you are proud of. This is your reality. This is who you are.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Imagine yourself six months from now. A year from now. Nail biting is a distant memory. You hardly think of it. Freedom is complete.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This future is assured if you continue using your tools. The neural pathways of the old habit are weakening every day. The pathways of freedom are strengthening.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

you have the knowledge, the skills, and the identity. You are someone who does not bite their nails. Go and live as that person.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Return to these sessions whenever you need reinforcement. Use the daily boosters. Your freedom is maintained by practice.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

As I count from one to ten, return to full waking consciousness.

One... beginning to return.
Two... carrying lasting freedom.
Three... refreshed.
Four... becoming alert.
Five... halfway back.
Six... alertness increasing.
Seven... feeling wonderful.
Eight... almost there.
Nine... nearly awake.
Ten... eyes open, fully alert. You are free, Austin. Go in peace.
