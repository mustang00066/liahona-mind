[BEGIN SCRIPT]

=== PRE-TALK / SETTLING (2-3 minutes) ===

Welcome back, Austin. Find a comfortable position now and allow yourself to settle into stillness. You have made remarkable progress on your journey to freedom from nail biting.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

In our previous sessions, you developed awareness, learned the wrist tap and competing response, and explored the emotional roots of this habit. Today we take the most powerful step of all: building a new identity.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The most lasting changes happen not at the level of behavior, but at the level of identity. When you see yourself as someone who does not bite their nails, the behavior naturally follows. You do not struggle or fight—you simply act in accordance with who you are.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Today, you will step into this new identity. Not as wishful thinking, but as emerging reality. The old identity is fading. The new you is taking its place. Let us begin.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== INDUCTION - Eye Fatigue and Diaphragmatic Breathing (10-12 minutes) ===

Before we close your eyes, find a spot above your natural line of sight. Perhaps on the ceiling... or high on the wall ahead. Focus your eyes on that spot now.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Notice how this upward gaze begins to tire your eye muscles. As your eyes fatigue, old identities begin to loosen. You are preparing to become something new.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

As you hold this gaze, begin your diaphragmatic breathing. Belly breathing... when you breathe in, your belly expands. When you breathe out, your belly button sinks toward your spine.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Breathe in deeply through your nose... let your belly rise... hold for a moment... and release slowly through your mouth. With each exhale, the old identity releases a little more.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

This breathing stimulates your vagus nerve, bringing deep calm and openness to transformation. You are becoming ready to accept who you truly are.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Take another deep belly breath. Your eyes still focused upward... heavier... more tired. Breathe in... belly expanding... hold... and release. The new identity is crystallizing.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

One more breath. And as you exhale this time, allow your eyes to close. Let them fall shut with relief. You are entering a state of profound transformation.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Good. Now imagine your neck becoming like a bundle of loose rubber bands. All tension dissolving. Your head floating gently... like a helium balloon.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Allow your jaws to sag. Your mouth opening slightly. Your tongue resting loosely. The forehead smoothing out completely. Old patterns in your face relaxing away.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let your shoulders sag completely. Shoulders dropping... dropping... as low as they can go. The weight of old habits falling from your shoulders.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

Your arms becoming limp, loose, and heavy. So limp, so loose, so heavy. And especially your hands, Austin. These hands that belong to the new you. Feel them completely at peace, completely free.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

Your legs and feet now. Let them go limp, loose, and heavy.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

The better you feel, the deeper you go. The deeper you go, the better you feel. And the more completely the new identity takes hold.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

It feels so good to just relax. It feels so good to just breathe. It feels so good to become who you were always meant to be.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Your eyelids now... so relaxed they've become wonderfully heavy. As though gently stuck together. This heaviness is transformation completing.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

From head to toe, you are deeply relaxed. Your body is at peace. Your identity is shifting. You are becoming new.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== DEEPENING (8-10 minutes) ===

Now, imagine yourself at the top of a staircase. This staircase leads down to a sanctuary of identity transformation... a place where who you are can be fundamentally renewed.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

There are twenty steps. With each step, the new identity becomes more solid, more real. By the bottom, you will be the person who does not bite their nails.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step twenty. You place your foot on the first step. The old identity begins to fade.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Nineteen. Another step down. The new identity growing stronger.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Eighteen. Deeper now. Transformation accelerating.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Seventeen. Going deeper. Old patterns releasing.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Sixteen. New neural pathways forming.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Fifteen. Past the surface. Into fundamental change.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Fourteen. Deeper and deeper. The new you becoming solid.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Thirteen. So ready to be transformed. So ready to be new.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Twelve. The sanctuary of identity change coming into view.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Eleven. Your subconscious accepting this new truth about who you are.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Ten. Halfway there. Halfway to complete transformation.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Nine. Every cell knowing the new identity.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Eight. Deeper. More transformed. More renewed.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Seven. Almost there. The sanctuary waiting.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Six. Profound change. Profound renewal.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Five. So deep now. The new identity nearly complete.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Four. The old habit identity cannot survive here.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Three. The final steps.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Two. One more step.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

One. You step into the sanctuary of identity transformation.

[PAUSE 8 SECONDS]

You are now in a place where identity itself can be changed. The old you—the one who bit their nails—is fading like a morning mist. The new you—the one with healthy, strong nails—is becoming solid and real. This is not imagination. This is becoming.

[PAUSE 8 SECONDS]

=== THERAPEUTIC CONTENT (15-18 minutes) ===

You remain in complete control. Your deeper mind will accept only the suggestions that align with your values and serve your growth. Everything else simply fades away.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

--- The Power of Identity ---

Austin, research in psychology has revealed a profound truth: the most powerful and lasting changes happen at the level of identity. When we change who we believe ourselves to be, behavior naturally follows.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Consider: a person who identifies as a non-smoker does not need willpower to avoid cigarettes. They simply do not smoke. It is not an option because it is not who they are.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The same principle applies here. When you identify as someone who does not bite their nails, you do not need constant vigilance. You simply do not bite. It is not an option because it is not who you are.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

This is far more powerful than behavioral change alone. Behavioral change requires ongoing effort. Identity change requires only being who you are.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

--- Who You Are Becoming ---

Let us explore who you are becoming. This is not fantasy—this is your emerging reality.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You are someone with healthy, strong nails. Look at your hands in your mind's eye. See the nails—smooth, clean, properly shaped. Nails that have been cared for, not damaged. Nails you can show others without embarrassment.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Feel the pride and satisfaction of having nails you are not ashamed of. This is your reality now. This is who you are.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

You are someone who cares for their hands. When you notice a rough edge, you reach for a file—not your teeth. When your nails need attention, you give it properly. Your hands are valuable instruments, and you treat them that way.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

You are someone who faces emotions directly. When feelings arise—anxiety, boredom, frustration, sadness—you notice them, name them, and address them directly. You do not need the habit to cope because you have better ways.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

You are someone with healthy self-soothing. When you need comfort, you find it in breath, in movement, in connection, in prayer. Your hands remain at peace.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

You are someone with self-mastery. You have proven that you can change a deeply ingrained pattern. This victory teaches you something important about your capability. You are stronger than you knew.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

--- How the New You Thinks ---

Let us explore how this new version of you thinks.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When an urge arises, the old you thought: "I want to bite. I shouldn't, but I want to." There was a struggle, a battle.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The new you thinks differently. When an urge arises—if it even does—the new you observes it with curiosity rather than engagement. "There is an urge. Interesting." There is no struggle because there is no question. Biting is simply not what you do.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The old you thought about nails frequently—worrying about them, wanting to hide them, feeling ashamed.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The new you barely thinks about nails at all. They are just part of your body, receiving normal care like any other part. There is nothing to worry about, nothing to hide.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The old you saw hands moving toward mouth and felt alarm—"Stop! Don't!"

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The new you does not have this experience. Hands simply do not move toward mouth for biting. It is as natural as not putting your elbow in your ear. The thought does not arise because the action is not in your repertoire.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

--- How the New You Feels ---

Let us explore how this new version of you feels.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The new you feels confident about your hands. When you gesture, when you shake hands, when you point or wave, you feel no self-consciousness. Your hands are simply your hands—healthy and normal.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The new you feels proud of the journey you have taken. You changed something that once seemed impossible to change. This pride is quiet and solid—not boastful, just satisfied.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The new you feels free. The mental energy that once went toward fighting urges, hiding hands, and feeling ashamed is now available for other things. There is a lightness, an openness.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The new you feels emotionally capable. You know you can face difficult feelings without needing to do something about them. This capability extends beyond nail biting—it changes how you handle life.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

--- How the New You Acts ---

Let us explore how this new version of you acts.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The new you keeps nails properly cared for. Regular trimming. Filing rough edges. Moisturizing cuticles. Simple maintenance that prevents the conditions that might have triggered biting in the past.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The new you uses hands confidently in public. No hiding in pockets. No curling fingers to conceal nails. No awkward positioning. Just natural, easy use of your hands.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The new you responds to urges automatically. If an urge ever arises, gentle fists form without conscious decision. The urge passes. Hands relax. Victory requires no effort.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The new you addresses emotions as they come. Anxiety is met with breath. Boredom is met with engagement. Frustration is met with expression. The old pattern of turning to nails is simply not in the repertoire.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

--- The Scripture of Transformation ---

The scripture teaches beautifully about identity transformation. The Apostle Paul wrote that through Christ, we become new creatures. Old things pass away. Behold, all things become new.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

This is exactly what is happening within you. The old creature—the one who bit nails as a way to cope—is passing away. A new creature is emerging—one who does not need this habit, one whose hands are at peace.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The Savior's grace supports this transformation. He does not love you more with healthy nails—He loves you completely always. But He delights in your growth. He celebrates your becoming.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

You are not changing to earn love. You are changing because growth and becoming are what souls do. And divine help supports every genuine effort toward wholeness.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

--- The Identity Statement ---

Let us cement this new identity with a powerful statement. Listen carefully, and when I invite you, repeat this silently to yourself.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Here is your identity statement: I am someone who does not bite their nails.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Not "I am trying not to bite." Not "I want to stop biting." Not "I should not bite."

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

I am someone who does not bite their nails.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

This is present tense. This is declarative. This is identity, not aspiration.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Now, silently repeat this to yourself. Feel its truth taking hold.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

I am someone who does not bite their nails.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Say it again in your mind. Let every part of you hear it.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

I am someone who does not bite their nails.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Once more, with complete acceptance. This is who you are.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

I am someone who does not bite their nails.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

This statement is becoming more true with every passing moment. Each time you do not bite, it becomes more true. Each day that passes, it becomes more true. The new identity is solidifying.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Direct Suggestions ---

And now, as you rest in this deeply transformed state, your subconscious mind fully accepts these truths.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You are someone who does not bite their nails. This identity is installed at the deepest level of your being. It governs your behavior naturally.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Urges, if they arise at all, are simply echoes of the old identity. You observe them as curiosities. They have no power because they are not who you are anymore.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Your hands know they are free. They have healthy, strong nails. They receive proper care. They move through the world with confidence.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

With each passing day, the new identity becomes more solid, more natural, more effortless. You are not trying to be this person—you simply are this person.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

--- Reinforcing the Anchor ---

Press your thumb and first finger together now.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Your anchor now carries your complete identity. Thumb and first finger together means: I am aware. I notice my hands. I form gentle fists when needed. I address emotional needs directly. And I am someone who does not bite their nails.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Hold the pressure. Feel your complete new identity flowing into your fingers.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Release. The anchor carries everything you need.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Future Pacing ---

See yourself tomorrow. Moving through your day with your new identity firmly in place. Hands at peace. Nails healthy. No struggle, no fight—just being who you are.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

A week from now. The new identity has become normal. You barely think about it. Nail biting is simply something you do not do.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

A month from now. Your nails have grown and healed. Looking at your hands brings a quiet satisfaction. The old habit feels like something from another lifetime.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

A year from now. You may not even remember what it was like to bite your nails. The behavior is so foreign to your current identity that memories of it seem strange. You are—and have been for a long time—someone who does not bite their nails.

[PAUSE 8 SECONDS]

=== POST-HYPNOTIC SUGGESTIONS (2-3 minutes) ===

As you rest in this transformed state, your subconscious is cementing everything. The new identity is fully installed.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

In the days ahead, you will find yourself simply being who you are. Not trying, not fighting—just being. The behavior follows naturally from the identity.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

If old patterns ever try to resurface, remember: those are echoes of someone you no longer are. The new you observes them with curiosity and lets them pass.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Continue to use your identity statement. Say it to yourself: I am someone who does not bite their nails. Each repetition strengthens the neural pathways of who you are becoming.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

The scripture teaches: be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind. Your mind is renewed. Your identity is transformed. You are new.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== EMERGENCE (3-5 minutes) ===

And now, Austin, it's time to return to full waking consciousness. The identity you have claimed here is fully installed. It comes with you into every moment of your life.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

In a moment, I will count from one to ten. With each number, you'll become more alert, more awake, more refreshed... as the person you truly are.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One. Beginning to return. Your new identity coming with you.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Two. Becoming more aware of your body. Your fingers and toes beginning to move—the fingers and toes of someone with healthy nails.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Three. The room around you becoming more present. Your new self ready to engage with the world.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Four. More alert now. Energy returning to your body.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Five. Halfway back. Feeling transformed and renewed.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Six. Your eyes may flutter. Your body preparing to return.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Seven. More and more alert. The new identity solid within you.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Eight. Almost there. Taking a deep, refreshing breath.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Nine. Ready to open your eyes and live as who you are.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Ten. Eyes open, fully awake, completely alert, and transformed.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Welcome back, Austin. Take a moment to appreciate the transformation that has occurred. You are now someone who does not bite their nails. This is not a goal—this is your identity.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

In the coming days, simply live as who you are. Use your identity statement whenever it helps: I am someone who does not bite their nails. The behavior will follow naturally from who you are.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

You are transformed. You are renewed. You are free.
