=== PRE-TALK / SETTLING (2-3 minutes) ===

Welcome, Austin. Find a comfortable position now, whether sitting or lying down. Allow your body to settle into stillness. This is your time for healing and transformation.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Take a moment to congratulate yourself for being here. By choosing to address this habit, you are taking an important step toward greater self-mastery and freedom. Our bodies are temples, sacred gifts from our Heavenly Father, and caring for them is an act of gratitude.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Nail biting may seem like a small thing, but you know how it affects you. The embarrassment of hiding your hands. The frustration of wanting to stop but finding yourself doing it anyway. The pain when you've bitten too far. Today begins your journey to freedom from all of that.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Over these six sessions, you will learn to understand this habit, become aware of your triggers, develop a powerful competing response, address the emotional roots, build a new identity, and maintain your freedom for life. This first session focuses on understanding—because awareness is the foundation of all change.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== INDUCTION - Eye Fatigue and Diaphragmatic Breathing (10-12 minutes) ===

Before we close your eyes, find a spot above your natural line of sight. Perhaps on the ceiling... or high on the wall ahead. Focus your eyes on that spot now.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Notice how this upward gaze begins to tire your eye muscles. As your eyes fatigue, relaxation begins to spread. The everyday tension you carry starts to dissolve.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

As you hold this gaze, begin your diaphragmatic breathing. Belly breathing... when you breathe in, your belly expands outward. When you breathe out, your belly button sinks toward your spine.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Breathe in deeply through your nose... let your belly rise... hold for a moment... and release slowly through your mouth. With each exhale, tension leaves your body.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

This breathing stimulates your vagus nerve, activating your body's natural relaxation response. Calm spreads through your system. Your nervous system is settling.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Take another deep belly breath. Your eyes still focused upward... heavier... more tired. Breathe in... belly expanding... hold... and release. You are moving toward peace.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

One more breath. And as you exhale this time, allow your eyes to close. Let them fall shut with relief. You are entering a state of deep receptivity.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Good. Now imagine your neck becoming like a bundle of loose rubber bands. All tension dissolving. Your head floating gently... like a helium balloon.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Allow your jaws to sag. Your mouth opening slightly. Your tongue resting loosely. The forehead smoothing out... any worry lines fading completely.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let your shoulders sag completely. Shoulders dropping... dropping... as low as they can go. The weight of stress and tension falling away.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

Your arms becoming limp, loose, and heavy. So limp, so loose, so heavy... like heavy lead weights. And now pay special attention to your hands, Austin. These hands that will soon be free from this habit. Feel them relaxing completely. Your palms softening. Your fingers gently uncurling. Heavy and peaceful.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

Your legs and feet now. Let them go limp, loose, and heavy. Complete surrender to relaxation.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

The better you feel, the deeper you go. The deeper you go, the better you feel. And the more receptive you become to positive change.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

It feels so good to just relax. It feels so good to just breathe. It feels so good to know that freedom from this habit is possible.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Your eyelids now... so relaxed they've become wonderfully heavy. As though gently stuck together. This heaviness is healing. This heaviness is transformation.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

From head to toe, you are deeply relaxed. Your body is at peace. Your mind is open. You are ready to understand and begin to change.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== DEEPENING (8-10 minutes) ===

Now, imagine yourself at the top of a staircase. This staircase leads down to a sanctuary of understanding and transformation... a place where change happens easily and naturally.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

There are twenty steps. With each step, you go deeper into relaxation and openness. By the bottom, you will be ready to receive powerful suggestions for change.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step twenty. You place your foot on the first step. Already relaxation is deepening.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Nineteen. Another step down. Your mind becoming more receptive.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Eighteen. Deeper now. The outside world fading.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Seventeen. Going deeper. Nothing matters but my voice and your healing.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Sixteen. So calm. So peaceful. So open to change.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Fifteen. Halfway down. The sanctuary coming into view.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Fourteen. Deeper and deeper. More and more relaxed.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Thirteen. Your subconscious mind is opening wide to receive.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Twelve. The sanctuary of transformation waiting for you.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Eleven. Every suggestion I offer will be received powerfully.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Ten. Halfway there. Deep peace filling you.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Three. The final steps.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Two. One more step.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

One. You step into the sanctuary of transformation.

[PAUSE 8 SECONDS]

You are now in a place where deep change happens easily. Your subconscious mind is open, receptive, and ready. Every suggestion I offer will be received and integrated into your being. This is where freedom begins.

[PAUSE 8 SECONDS]

=== THERAPEUTIC CONTENT (15-18 minutes) ===

You remain in complete control. Your deeper mind will accept only the suggestions that align with your values and serve your growth. Everything else simply fades away.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

--- Understanding Nail Biting ---

In this peaceful state, Austin, let us understand nail biting with compassion rather than judgment.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Nail biting is classified as a body-focused repetitive behavior, or BFRB. It is not a character flaw. It is not a sign of weakness. It is not a moral failing. It is simply a pattern that your brain learned, usually in childhood, as a way to cope with certain feelings or situations.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Your brain is incredibly good at learning patterns. When something provides even a small sense of relief or satisfaction, the brain records it: "This helps. Do this again." Over time, the pattern becomes automatic. You may not even realize you're doing it until you're already biting.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

This automatic nature is why willpower alone often fails. The behavior lives in the subconscious mind, below conscious awareness. That's exactly why hypnotherapy is so effective—it speaks directly to the subconscious, where the pattern actually lives.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

--- The Habit Loop ---

All habits, including nail biting, follow a three-part cycle. Understanding this cycle is the first step to breaking it.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

First, there is a trigger—something that initiates the behavior. Triggers can be external, like certain situations or environments. Or they can be internal, like emotions or physical sensations.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Common triggers for nail biting include: anxiety or stress, boredom, concentration on a task, watching television, feeling hungry, perfectionism about the nails themselves, or simply seeing or feeling a rough edge.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Second, there is the routine—the behavior itself. Your hands move toward your mouth. Teeth find nail. Biting begins. This routine often happens without conscious thought, carried by momentum and habit.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Third, there is the reward—whatever benefit the brain perceives from the behavior. For nail biting, the rewards might include: a brief reduction in anxiety, relief from boredom, something to do with hands, the satisfaction of "fixing" a rough nail, or simply the familiar comfort of a well-worn pattern.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

To break the habit, we must address all three parts. We will increase your awareness of triggers. We will give you a powerful alternative behavior called a competing response. And we will help you find healthier ways to get the rewards you seek.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

--- Why You Bite Your Nails ---

Let's explore some of the reasons behind this behavior, Austin. As I describe these, notice if any resonate with you.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Some people bite their nails to manage anxiety. The repetitive motion is soothing, providing a sense of control when feeling overwhelmed. The focus on the nails temporarily distracts from anxious thoughts.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Some bite their nails out of boredom. The hands crave activity. Without something productive to do, they find something on their own. Nail biting fills the void.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Some bite during concentration. Certain tasks require intense focus, and the biting becomes an accompaniment to thinking—a way to channel mental energy through physical action.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Some bite due to perfectionism. They notice an imperfection in a nail—a rough edge, an uneven shape—and feel compelled to "fix" it. But the fixing often makes things worse, leading to more biting in an attempt to even things out.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Some bite habitually, without any particular trigger. The behavior is so ingrained that it happens automatically, in many situations, without any conscious intent.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

You may identify with one of these, or several, or something not mentioned. What matters is not judging the why, but simply understanding it. Understanding creates the possibility of change.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

--- The Power of Awareness ---

The most important skill you will develop is awareness—noticing when you're biting or about to bite.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Right now, much of your biting happens without awareness. Your hands move to your mouth automatically. You may not realize you're doing it until you've already been biting for some time.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Through this work, you will develop what we call "early warning detection." You will notice the urge before it leads to action. You will feel the subtle signs: the restlessness in your hands, the thoughts about your nails, the drift of your hand toward your face.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

This awareness creates a gap—a space between trigger and response where choice becomes possible. In that gap, you can use your competing response. In that gap, you can make a different choice. Awareness is power.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

--- The Wrist Tap ---

In the next session, we will introduce a specific awareness technique: the wrist tap. Whenever you notice your hand moving toward your mouth, you will tap your opposite wrist. This simple gesture does three things.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

First, it interrupts the automatic pattern, breaking the momentum.

Second, it brings your attention to the present moment and to what you're doing.

Third, it creates a deliberate pause where you can choose a different action.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

For now, simply know that this tool is coming. Your awareness is already beginning to increase, preparing you to use it effectively.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Your Hands Deserve Care ---

Austin, consider your hands for a moment. These hands are valuable instruments. They serve you in countless ways every day. They write, they type, they create. They embrace loved ones, they gesture when you speak, they carry burdens and offer comfort.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Your Heavenly Father gave you these hands. They are part of the temple that is your body. They deserve care and respect, not harm.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Imagine your hands in the future—healthy, healed, with strong nails you can be proud of. Hands you don't have to hide. Hands that reflect the care you give yourself. This image is not a fantasy. It is your future, already taking shape.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Hold this image. Feel it. Know that it is becoming reality.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

--- Direct Suggestions ---

And now, as you rest in this deeply receptive state, your subconscious mind is ready to receive powerful suggestions for change.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

From this day forward, your awareness of nail biting increases dramatically. You notice your hands. You notice when they move toward your face. You notice the urge before it leads to action.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Your awareness of nail biting increases. This awareness happens automatically, without effort.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You begin to understand your triggers—the situations, emotions, and sensations that lead to biting. With each day, your understanding deepens.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

You are ready to change this pattern. Your subconscious mind is cooperating fully. The habit's grip is loosening.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

You believe in your ability to become free from this habit. With God's help, with the power of your own mind, you will succeed.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

--- Establishing the Anchor ---

Let us establish an anchor that will grow throughout these sessions.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Press your thumb and first finger of your right hand together now.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

As you hold this pressure, feel awareness flowing into your fingers. This gesture now carries the power of awareness—awareness of your hands, awareness of your habits, awareness of your choices.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Hold the pressure. Thumb and first finger together means: I am aware. I notice my hands. I have the power to choose.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

Release. The anchor is established. Use it whenever you want to increase your awareness. It will grow stronger with each session.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Future Pacing ---

See yourself tomorrow. Going about your normal activities. And you notice—you're more aware of your hands. When they move toward your face, you notice. You don't necessarily stop every time yet, but you notice. Awareness is growing.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

A week from now. Your awareness has increased substantially. You're catching yourself earlier. The gap between trigger and response is widening. Change is happening.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

A month from now. You have developed a complete system for managing this habit. Awareness, competing response, emotional tools—all working together. Your nails are beginning to heal.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

A year from now. Nail biting is a distant memory. Your hands are healthy and strong. You've proven to yourself that you can overcome patterns that once seemed impossible to change. This victory has taught you something important about your own capability.

[PAUSE 8 SECONDS]

=== POST-HYPNOTIC SUGGESTIONS (2-3 minutes) ===

As you rest in this peaceful state, your subconscious is integrating everything. These changes are taking root.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

In the days ahead, you will notice increased awareness of your hands and your habits. This is a sign that the work is taking hold. Welcome it.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Each time you listen to this session, your awareness deepens. Your commitment strengthens. Your path to freedom becomes clearer.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Remember: the scripture teaches that with God, all things are possible. This includes overcoming this habit. You have divine help available.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Remember: nail biting is not a character flaw. It is simply a pattern that can be changed. And you are changing it, starting now.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== EMERGENCE (3-5 minutes) ===

And now, Austin, it's time to return to full waking consciousness. The awareness you've gained here comes with you. The understanding you've developed remains.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

In a moment, I will count from one to ten. With each number, you'll become more alert, more awake, more refreshed... while keeping your increased awareness.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One. Beginning to return. Awareness coming with you.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Two. Becoming more aware of your body. Your fingers and toes beginning to move.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Three. The room around you becoming more present. Your understanding intact.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Four. More alert now. Energy returning to your body.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Five. Halfway back. Feeling wonderfully refreshed and aware.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Six. Your eyes may flutter. Your body preparing to return.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Seven. More and more alert. Feeling confident and capable.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Eight. Almost there. Taking a deep, refreshing breath.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Nine. Ready to open your eyes and begin your journey to freedom.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Ten. Eyes open, fully awake, completely alert, and on your path to freedom.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Welcome back, Austin. Take a moment to appreciate that you've begun something important. You now understand this habit in a new way. Awareness is awakening. Change is coming.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

In the coming days, simply notice. Notice your hands. Notice your triggers. Notice the urge. Don't fight—just notice. Awareness is the foundation of everything that follows.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

You are on your path to freedom. Trust the process. Trust yourself. Trust in heavenly help. You will succeed.
