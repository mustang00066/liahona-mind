Duration: ~32 minutes
Voice: Male, British accent, calm and warm

[BEGIN SCRIPT]

Welcome back, Austin. You have come so far in this journey. Today we focus on who you are becoming, a person with healthy hands, strong self-control, and mastery over old habits.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Take your deep, relaxing breath now... and let it go.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Another breath, going deeper... and release.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One more breath, and close your eyes, entering hypnosis easily and naturally.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Allow the familiar wave of relaxation to wash through you. Head to toe, releasing everything. Your body knows this feeling now. It relaxes quickly and deeply.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Descending now, ten to one, into that deep, receptive state where transformation occurs.

Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Deep hypnosis.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

identity is powerful. How you see yourself shapes your behavior. If you see yourself as a nail biter, you will bite your nails. But if you see yourself as someone with healthy hands and self-control, that becomes your reality.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Today we reshape your identity around this habit. We update the internal image you hold of yourself. We align your self-concept with the person you are becoming.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You are no longer simply trying to stop a behavior. You are becoming someone for whom that behavior is foreign. Someone who naturally cares for their hands. Someone for whom biting nails simply is not something they do.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Think of it this way: a non-smoker doesn't have to resist smoking. It's not who they are. Similarly, a person who doesn't bite their nails doesn't have to fight the urge. It's simply not part of their identity.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

You are transitioning, from being a nail biter working on quitting, to being someone who simply doesn't bite their nails. This is a fundamental shift.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let us build this new identity now. In your mind, see yourself in the future. Maybe a month from now, maybe three months. You are living your life, and your hands are beautiful and healthy.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

See the details. Your nails have grown out, strong and smooth. No ragged edges, no torn cuticles. Hands you are proud to show anyone. Hands that reflect self-care and self-respect.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Notice how you feel in this future self. Confident. Free. You've overcome something that bothered you for years. You proved you could change. This victory gives you confidence in other areas of life.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

See yourself interacting with others. You gesture while talking without any self-consciousness. You shake hands confidently. You no longer hide your fingers or sit on your hands. Freedom.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This future is not some other person. This is you, the real you, the you that is emerging. The old habit was never truly part of your core identity. It was just a pattern that developed. And patterns can change.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Now, step into this future version of yourself. Merge with that image. Feel what it feels like to be this person with healthy hands. Let this identity settle into every cell of your being.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

This is who you are now, Austin. The transformation is already happening. Your subconscious is accepting this new identity. Your behavior is aligning with this new self-concept.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When temptation arises in the future, you will respond from this new identity. You will think, I am someone who cares for my hands. Biting them is not what I do. And the urge will dissolve in the face of this truth.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The Savior said, ye must be born again. This is a kind of rebirth. You are leaving behind the old self who bit their nails and emerging as a new creation who does not. This is growth. This is change. This is redemption.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let us strengthen this new identity with ego strengthening suggestions. These are positive affirmations that your subconscious mind absorbs as truth.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

you are capable of change. You have already proven this by how far you have come in these sessions.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

You are stronger than your habits. The urges do not control you. You control your responses.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

You deserve healthy, beautiful hands. They are temples for your spirit, and you treat them with respect.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Each day, your self-control grows stronger. Each day, the old habit fades further into the past.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

You are becoming the person you were always meant to be. Self-assured, disciplined, free.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

These truths are sinking deep into your subconscious now. They are becoming the lens through which you see yourself. Your identity is being rebuilt on a solid foundation.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

From now on, when you look in the mirror, you will see someone with self-control. When you look at your hands, you will see hands that you care for. When you think about nail biting, it will feel like something from your past, not your present.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

part of this new identity includes how you handle setbacks. If you ever slip and bite, you will not shame yourself. You will not say, I knew I couldn't change. You will simply say, That was a moment of old behavior. It does not define me. I am someone who is overcoming this, and I will continue.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Setbacks do not erase progress. They are part of the journey. The person you are becoming handles setbacks with grace, learns from them, and keeps moving forward.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

See yourself handling a setback with this grace. You notice you've bitten. You pause. You have compassion for yourself. You recommit to your new identity. You apply your tools. And you continue on, undefeated.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

This is resilience. This is growth. This is the character of a disciple who falls, repents, and rises again.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your new identity is now firmly established in your subconscious mind. You are someone with healthy hands. You are someone with self-control. You are someone who has overcome this habit.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Carry this identity with you as we prepare to return. Let it inform your choices today and every day.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

One... beginning to return.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Two... bringing your new identity with you.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Three... feeling confident and strong.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Four... almost fully awake.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Five... eyes open. You know who you are, Austin. Live from that truth today.
