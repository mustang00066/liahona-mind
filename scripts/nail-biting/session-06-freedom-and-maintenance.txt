Duration: ~33 minutes
Voice: Male, British accent, calm and warm

[BEGIN SCRIPT]

Welcome to your final session in this series, Austin. You have journeyed far, learned powerful tools, and transformed your relationship with this habit. Today we seal your freedom and prepare you for lasting success.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Take a celebratory breath in... and release with satisfaction.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Another breath, appreciating how far you have come... and release.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One final breath for this session, and enter hypnosis now, easily and deeply.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Your body knows exactly how to relax now. Let it happen automatically. From head to toe, deep peace spreading through every part of you.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Descend quickly and comfortably. Ten to one, going deep. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Deep hypnosis achieved.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

look at what you have accomplished. You came to these sessions seeking freedom from nail biting. And through your commitment, your faith, and the power of your own mind, you have found it.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let us review the tools you now possess. First, awareness. You recognize your triggers. You notice the early signs of an urge. You are no longer operating on autopilot but with conscious intention.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Second, the competing response. When urges arise, you close your hand in a gentle fist, or use an alternative, and hold until the urge passes. This simple technique has proven power.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Third, emotional understanding. You have explored the roots of the habit and brought healing light to whatever feelings fueled it. You have new ways to handle difficult emotions.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Fourth, identity transformation. You no longer see yourself as a nail biter trying to quit. You are someone who simply does not bite their nails. Your self-concept has shifted.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

These tools are now permanent parts of your mental toolkit. They are wired into your subconscious. They activate automatically when needed.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Now let us address maintenance. Overcoming a habit is wonderful, but maintaining that freedom requires ongoing attention. Here is how you will ensure lasting success.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

First, continue to care for your nails. Keep them trimmed and smooth. When there are no rough edges to notice, there is less trigger to bite. A simple nail file can be your friend.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Second, stay aware. Even when the habit feels completely gone, remain conscious of your hands. Check in occasionally. This vigilance prevents relapse before it starts.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Third, manage your stress. Stress is the most common trigger for habit relapse. Continue to use healthy coping mechanisms, prayer, breath, exercise, connection with others. A calm life supports nail health.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Fourth, if you ever slip, respond with grace. Do not catastrophize a single bite into total failure. Notice, learn, recommit, and continue. One slip does not undo your progress.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The Savior taught that we must forgive seventy times seven. Apply this to yourself. Forgive your moments of weakness and keep moving forward. His grace is sufficient for you.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Imagine yourself now, six months in the future. Your nails have been healthy all this time. The habit feels like ancient history. You barely remember what it was like to bite.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

See yourself in a year. The victory is complete and normal. You don't even think about nail biting anymore. It is simply not part of your life. This is your destination, and you will reach it.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Feel the gratitude that fills you. Gratitude to your Heavenly Father for the power of change. Gratitude to yourself for the commitment you made. Gratitude for the tools and techniques that served you.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

you have proven that change is possible. This victory over nail biting is evidence of your strength. If you can overcome this, you can overcome other challenges too. This is the beginning of greater self-mastery.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let us install a final set of powerful suggestions. These will remain with you, supporting your freedom for years to come.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Your hands are precious. They are instruments of service, creativity, and connection. You will continue to care for them as the valuable gifts they are.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Urges to bite, if they ever arise, will be weak and easily dismissed. Your new patterns are strong. The competing response activates automatically. The urge passes quickly.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

You are permanently free from this habit. The neural pathways that supported it have weakened to nothing. The new pathways of self-care and self-control are dominant.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Each day, your hands remind you of your victory. Looking at your healthy nails brings quiet pride. You did this, Austin. With God's help and your own effort, you changed.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

These suggestions are now sealed in your subconscious mind. They will remain active, supporting your freedom, for the rest of your life.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

as we close this series, remember that you can return to these sessions anytime. If you ever feel the old habit trying to resurface, listen to a session again. Reinforcement strengthens the programming.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

But I believe that will rarely be necessary. You have done the deep work. You have transformed at the level of identity. The old who bit his nails is in the past. The new who cares for his hands is present and permanent.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Go forth in freedom. Your hands are healed. Your habit is broken. Your transformation is complete.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Let the truth of this settle deeply. You are free. You are free. You are free.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Now, as I count from one to five, you will return to full waking consciousness, carrying your freedom with you. This is a graduation. Celebrate it.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

One... beginning to return, feeling victorious.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Two... energy and joy filling your body.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Three... becoming alert, feeling proud of yourself.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Four... almost fully awake.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Five... eyes open, fully alert, completely free. Congratulations, Austin. You have done something wonderful. Now go live it.
