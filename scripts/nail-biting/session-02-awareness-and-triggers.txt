Duration: ~32 minutes
Voice: Male, British accent, calm and warm

[BEGIN SCRIPT]

Welcome back, Austin. Find your comfortable position and allow yourself to settle in. You are continuing your journey toward freedom, and each session brings you closer to your goal.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Take a deep breath in now... and release it slowly. With this breath, you release any stress from your day.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Another breath in, deeper this time... and as you exhale, feel your body beginning to relax.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One more breath... and let your eyes close as you exhale, entering this space of peace and transformation.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let the relaxation begin at the top of your head and flow downward like warm water. Feel it washing over your scalp, your forehead, relaxing the muscles around your eyes, your cheeks, your jaw.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

This wave of relaxation continues down your neck, across your shoulders, releasing all tension. Down through your arms, into your hands. Your hands are especially relaxed now. Soft, warm, at peace.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The relaxation spreads through your chest and stomach, your back, down through your hips and legs, all the way to your feet. Your entire body is now deeply relaxed.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Imagine yourself descending a beautiful staircase. With each step down, you go deeper into relaxation. Ten steps, and with each one, you feel more peaceful, more receptive to positive change.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Ten... stepping down, relaxing more.
Nine... deeper and deeper.
Eight... so peaceful.
Seven... letting go completely.
Six... halfway down now.
Five... going deeper still.
Four... your mind is open and receptive.
Three... almost there.
Two... one more step.
One... you are now in a deep, peaceful state of hypnosis.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

today we deepen your awareness of the triggers that activate the nail biting habit. Understanding your triggers gives you power over them. When you see them coming, you can choose a different response.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

In Habit Reversal Training, this is called awareness training. It is the cornerstone of change. The research shows that simply becoming aware of when and why you do a habit significantly reduces its occurrence.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let us explore the common triggers together. As I mention each one, notice if it resonates with you. Your subconscious mind will recognize the patterns that apply to your life.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

The first common trigger is stress and anxiety. When we feel worried or pressured, our hands may seek something to do. The repetitive motion of nail biting can feel soothing in the moment, a way to discharge nervous energy.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Notice, the situations in your life that create stress. Work deadlines. Difficult conversations. Financial concerns. Family challenges. These may be times when your hands are more likely to wander toward your mouth.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The second trigger is boredom or understimulation. When the mind is not engaged, the hands may seek activity. Watching television, sitting in meetings, waiting in line, these moments of low mental engagement can activate the habit.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The third trigger is concentration. Interestingly, deep focus can also trigger nail biting. When you are absorbed in a task, reading, working on a computer, solving a problem, your hands may bite without your conscious awareness.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The fourth trigger is physical. Sometimes a rough edge on a nail, or a hangnail, activates the urge. You notice something imperfect and feel compelled to fix it. But biting often makes it worse, creating more rough edges, continuing the cycle.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The fifth trigger is emotional. Feelings like frustration, disappointment, loneliness, or even excitement can activate the habit. The behavior may have become linked to processing strong emotions.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Take a moment now, to let your subconscious identify which triggers are most relevant for you. You don't need to analyze consciously. Just allow the awareness to surface.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

Whatever your triggers are, they are now becoming visible to you. Like turning on a light in a dark room, awareness illuminates what was hidden. And what is seen can be changed.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The scripture teaches, the truth shall make you free. This truth about your triggers is part of your freedom. Each trigger you identify is a trigger you can prepare for.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Now, let us develop your early warning system. The habit of nail biting follows a sequence. First comes the trigger. Then comes the urge. Then the hand moves toward the mouth. Then the biting occurs.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

The earlier in this sequence you become aware, the easier it is to interrupt. If you catch yourself mid-bite, stopping is possible but difficult. If you catch the urge before your hand moves, stopping is much easier.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

What does the urge feel like for you, Austin? Perhaps a restless feeling in your fingers. A tingly sensation. A thought about your nails. A sense that something needs to be done. Your early warning signs are unique to you.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

From now on, your sensitivity to these early warning signs increases dramatically. It is as if you have installed an internal alarm system. When the trigger activates and the urge begins, a gentle alert goes off in your mind. A quiet notification: urge arising.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This awareness does not create anxiety. It creates choice. When you notice the urge, you can say to yourself, I notice I have an urge to bite my nails. What shall I do instead?

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The simple act of noticing and naming the urge breaks the automatic loop. You are no longer on autopilot. You are the conscious director of your actions.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let us install this awareness more deeply. Imagine yourself going through a typical day. See yourself in the morning, preparing for the day. Watch yourself moving through your activities.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Now, in your imagination, a trigger arises. Perhaps stress about something you need to do. Perhaps boredom during a lull. Watch as the urge begins to form.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

And now, see yourself noticing the urge. You become aware. A gentle internal signal alerts you. In your mind, you hear the words: I notice an urge to bite my nails.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

See yourself pause. You do not act on the urge. You simply observe it. And in that observation, the urge begins to weaken. It peaks, plateaus, and then fades, like a wave that rises and falls.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

This is called urge surfing. The urge is like a wave. If you can ride it out without acting, it will pass. Urges always pass. They may feel urgent, but they are temporary. And each time you let an urge pass without acting, it becomes weaker the next time.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The Apostle Paul wrote, there hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The urge to bite is not stronger than you are. It is a sensation, a wave of feeling. And you can let it pass. God provides the way of escape, and awareness is that way.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Now, let us anchor this awareness with a physical trigger. This is a technique from Habit Reversal Training. You will create a connection between a simple action and the state of awareness.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Whenever you gently tap your wrist twice with your other hand, you will instantly become aware of your hands and any urges present. This tap is your awareness anchor.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

In your mind now, practice this. Imagine tapping your wrist twice. As you do, feel your awareness sharpen. You become conscious of your hands, your fingers, any sensations present. You are alert and aware.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This anchor is now being installed in your subconscious mind. Whenever you tap your wrist twice, awareness activates. You become present and conscious of your behavior.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You can use this anchor throughout your day. In moments when you know triggers are likely, tap your wrist. When you want to check in with your hands, tap your wrist. This simple action keeps you conscious and in control.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Another powerful technique is called situation awareness. For the next few days, I want you to mentally note whenever you find yourself in a triggering situation. You don't need to write anything down, simply notice and acknowledge.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

This is a stressful moment. Or, I am bored right now. Or, I am deeply focused. By naming the situation, you prepare yourself. You activate your awareness before the urge even begins.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

you are developing a new relationship with this habit. Instead of being controlled by it, you are becoming the observer, the one who notices, the one who chooses. This is the path to freedom.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Remember, there is no shame in having this habit. Millions of people share it. And there is no shame in the process of overcoming it, even if there are setbacks along the way. Each moment of awareness is a victory, even if you don't always succeed in stopping the behavior.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Progress, not perfection, is the goal. The Savior does not expect perfection from us in this life. He expects effort, growth, and reliance on Him. And that is exactly what you are offering.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

In the next session, you will learn the competing response, a specific action to do instead of biting when urges arise. Combined with your new awareness, this will give you a powerful system for change.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

But for now, let all of today's learning sink deep into your subconscious mind. The awareness is growing. The triggers are becoming visible. The early warning system is being installed.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

It is time to return to full waking consciousness. As I count from one to five, you will become alert and refreshed, carrying your new awareness with you.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

One... beginning to return. Energy flowing through your body.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Two... becoming more aware of your surroundings.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Three... feeling refreshed and positive. Your awareness is heightened.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Four... almost fully awake now.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Five... eyes open, fully alert. You are more aware than ever before, Austin. Notice your hands today. Notice your triggers. And know that you are making real progress.
