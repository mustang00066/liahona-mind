Duration: ~38 minutes
Voice: Male, British accent, calm and affirming

[BEGIN SCRIPT]

Welcome back, Austin. Today we learn to set boundaries. Confident people know where they end and others begin. You will learn to say no without guilt and yes with freedom.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Find your comfortable position. Take a deep breath in... hold gently... and release, feeling your own space.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Another breath, deeper... honoring your limits... hold... and release, self-respect building.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

One more breath... breathing in the right to have boundaries... hold... and as you exhale, let your eyes close and your sense of self strengthen.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let the golden light begin at your head. This light clarifies your boundaries. Scalp warming. Your sense of where you end becoming clear.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The warmth flows through your body, defining your space. This is you. You have the right to protect this space. To decide what enters. To decide what you give.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Now the staircase. Twenty steps down to clear boundaries.

Twenty, nineteen, eighteen, seventeen, sixteen... boundaries forming.
Fifteen, fourteen, thirteen, twelve, eleven... clarity increasing.
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six... self-respect deepening.
Five, four, three, two, one... complete boundary awareness achieved.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

You are in a place of clear self-definition. Here, you know who you are and what you will accept. Here, you have permission to protect yourself.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Boundaries are not selfish. They are necessary. Without boundaries, you are depleted, resentful, lost. With boundaries, you preserve energy for what matters.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Confident people say no to things that do not align with their values, time, or energy. They say no without excessive explanation or guilt.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Saying no to one thing is saying yes to something else. No to the draining commitment means yes to rest, to family, to your own priorities.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The Savior set boundaries. He withdrew to pray. He said no to demands that did not serve His mission. He did not meet every need presented to Him. He was selective.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You are allowed to be selective too. You do not owe everyone access to your time, energy, or attention.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let us practice setting a boundary. Think of a situation where you need to say no. Perhaps a request. Perhaps a relationship. Perhaps a pattern that drains you.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Now, formulate the boundary. What specifically will you say or do? Keep it simple. Keep it clear.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Notice any guilt arising. This guilt is not a signal that you are wrong. It is a habit from times when you believed your worth depended on pleasing others. You can acknowledge it and act anyway.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Say the boundary in your mind now. Calmly. Clearly. Without over-explaining. I cannot. I will not. That does not work for me.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Feel the relief of having a boundary. You are not trapped. You have choice. This is freedom.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

From now on, you will notice when a boundary is needed. You will feel the tension of something not right. And you will speak up.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You do not need to be aggressive. Boundaries can be set kindly. I appreciate the offer, but I cannot. I understand, but this does not work for me.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Others may not like your boundaries. That is okay. Your worth does not depend on their approval. You are allowed to disappoint people when necessary.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Good boundaries actually improve relationships. People respect those who respect themselves. Clear boundaries create clear interactions.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Rest in your bounded self now. You know where you end. You protect your space. You say no when needed and yes when desired. This is confidence.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

It is time to return. As I count from one to ten, you will become alert, carrying clear boundaries with you.

One... beginning to return.
Two... feeling boundaried and free.
Three... becoming more aware.
Four... refreshed and self-respecting.
Five... halfway back.
Six... alertness increasing.
Seven... feeling wonderful.
Eight... almost there.
Nine... nearly fully awake.
Ten... eyes open, fully alert. Your boundaries are clear now, Austin. Honor them.
