Duration: ~28 minutes

[BEGIN SCRIPT]

Welcome back, Austin. Today we work with your body. Confidence is physical. By changing how you hold your body, you change how you feel.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Take a deep breath in... hold... and release, feeling your body as a source of confidence.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Another breath, deeper... becoming aware of your physical presence... hold... and release.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One more breath... eyes closing, connecting with your body.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let the golden light of confidence transform your posture. Head lifting. Shoulders rolling back. Chest opening.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Descend now. Ten to one. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Complete embodiment.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your body and mind are connected. When you stand tall, you feel confident. When you slump, you feel defeated. The body leads.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Confident posture: Head high, chin level. Shoulders back and down. Chest open. Spine straight.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Confident people take up space. They do not shrink. They stand with feet hip-width apart. They gesture freely.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Eye contact is crucial. Look others in the eye—not aggressively, but openly.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let us practice. Imagine standing with head high. Chin level. Shoulders back. Chest lifted. Spine straight. Grounded.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Feel how this posture changes your state. More alert. More powerful. More present.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The scripture says the body is a temple. Carry your temple with dignity.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Check your posture regularly. Before important moments. When entering rooms. Reset to confident posture.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Confident posture makes you feel confident. Your body can generate confidence on demand.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One... beginning to return.
Two... feeling strong and grounded.
Three... becoming alert.
Four... refreshed and powerful.
Five... eyes open, fully alert. Stand tall, Austin. Your body knows confidence.
