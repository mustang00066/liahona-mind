=== PRE-TALK / SETTLING (1-2 minutes) ===

Welcome back, [NAME]. Today we work with something powerful: your body. Confidence is not just a feeling in your mind... it is a physical state.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Here is a remarkable truth: the mind and body are connected in both directions. By changing how you hold yourself, you can change how you feel. Your body can generate confidence, not just reflect it.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Today, you'll learn to use your body as a tool for creating confidence. Your posture, your movements, your presence will become sources of strength.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== INDUCTION - Rapid Relaxation (5-6 minutes) ===

Take a deep diaphragmatic breath. Belly breathing... belly expands in, sinks down out.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Breathe in through your nose... belly rising... and release. This calms your nervous system while heightening body awareness.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Another breath... and as you exhale, allow your eyes to close.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let your neck become loose like rubber bands. Head floating. Jaws sagging. Shoulders sagging completely for now.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Arms and hands becoming limp, loose, and heavy. Like lead weights. Legs and feet the same.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The better you feel, the deeper you go. The deeper you go, the better you feel.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your eyelids so relaxed they've become gently stuck together. This heaviness is preparation.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Imagine standing in a hall of mirrors showing how you carry yourself. Ten steps to the center where transformation happens.

=== THERAPEUTIC CONTENT (8-10 minutes) ===

--- The Mind-Body Connection ---

[NAME], when you adopt a powerful posture, your mind begins to feel powerful. When people hold expansive postures for two minutes, their hormones change. They feel more confident.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your body doesn't just reflect your inner state... it creates it.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Two minutes in this pose changes your hormones and mental state. Find a private space before important situations. Generate the confidence you need.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

--- Movement and Presence ---

Confident people move deliberately, with purpose. They enter rooms with presence. They make eye contact. They belong.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The scripture teaches your body is a temple. Carry your temple with dignity. Standing tall honors what God has given you.
