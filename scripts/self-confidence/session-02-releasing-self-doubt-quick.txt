Duration: ~28 minutes
Voice: Male, British accent, calm and affirming

[BEGIN SCRIPT]

Welcome back, Austin. Today we release self-doubt. That voice that whispers you cannot, you are not enough. You will learn to quiet it.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Take a deep breath in... hold... and release, beginning to loosen doubt's grip.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Another breath, deeper... breathing out uncertainty... hold... and release.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One more breath... eyes closing, doubt beginning to fade.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let the golden light of certainty dissolve doubt. Head to toe. Self-assurance emerging.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Descend now. Ten to one. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Complete self-belief.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Self-doubt is not wisdom. It disguises itself as realistic thinking, but it is fear wearing a mask.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

What doubt says is not usually true. It says you cannot when you can. It says you will fail when you might succeed.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The Savior asked Peter, Wherefore didst thou doubt? Peter walked on water until doubt made him sink. Doubt, not inability, was the problem.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Think of a doubt you carry. Is it absolutely true? Or is it fear? What evidence contradicts it?

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Say to the doubt: Thank you for trying to protect me. But you are not needed anymore. I trust myself now.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Feel the doubt loosening. It cannot survive examination.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When self-doubt speaks, recognize it. Say: That is doubt, not truth. Question it. Dismiss it.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Press your worth anchor. Thumb to ring finger. Doubt cannot coexist with knowing your worth.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Replace doubt: I am capable. I can figure this out. I trust myself.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One... beginning to return.
Two... feeling confident and capable.
Three... becoming alert.
Four... refreshed and self-assured.
Five... eyes open, fully alert. Doubt has lost its power, Austin.
