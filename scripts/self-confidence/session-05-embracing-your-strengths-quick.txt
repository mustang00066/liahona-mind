=== PRE-TALK / SETTLING (1-2 minutes) ===

Welcome back, Austin. Today we focus on embracing your strengths. Many people dismiss their gifts and focus only on their weaknesses. This is not humility; it is a failure to recognize what God has given you.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

True humility acknowledges your strengths and gives proper credit. Today, you will learn to see your genuine capabilities and own them without apology.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Your gifts are meant to be recognized and used, not buried.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== INDUCTION - Rapid Relaxation (5-6 minutes) ===

Take a deep diaphragmatic breath. Belly breathing... belly expands in, sinks down out.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Breathe in through your nose... belly rising... and release. Feel yourself ready to see clearly.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Another breath... and as you exhale, allow your eyes to close.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let your neck become loose like rubber bands. Head floating. Jaws sagging. Complete facial relaxation.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Arms and hands becoming limp, loose, and heavy. Like lead weights. Legs and feet the same.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The better you feel, the deeper you go. The deeper you go, the better you feel.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your eyelids so relaxed they've become gently stuck together. This heaviness is clarity.

=== THERAPEUTIC CONTENT (8-10 minutes) ===

--- True vs. False Humility ---

Austin, false humility says "I have no special abilities." This dismisses God's gifts. True humility says "I have strengths that come from God, and I will use them gratefully."

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The parable of the talents teaches that gifts are meant to be used, not buried. Two servants invested their talents and were praised. One buried his and was rebuked.

Consider what comes naturally to you. Understanding people. Solving problems. Creating. Organizing. Connecting with others. What flows easily for you? These are your natural talents.

Now consider skills you have built through effort. Expertise in your work. Patience developed through difficulty. Resilience proven by survival. These are genuine strengths.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

--- Character Strengths ---

Consider your character. Honesty. Kindness. Loyalty. Persistence. Fairness. Courage. These qualities of who you are represent your greatest assets.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]
