[BEGIN SCRIPT]

Welcome back, Austin. Today we embrace your strengths. Too often we focus on weaknesses. You will learn to see and own your gifts.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Take a deep breath in... hold... and release, opening to see yourself clearly.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Another breath, deeper... releasing false humility... hold... and release.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One more breath... eyes closing, seeing yourself truly.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let the golden light illuminate your strengths. Head to toe. Your true capabilities coming into view.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Descend now. Ten to one. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Complete awareness.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

True humility is not pretending to be less. It is knowing your strengths come from God and using them gratefully.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The parable of the talents: those who used their gifts were praised. Your strengths are meant to be acknowledged and deployed.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

What are your strengths? Things you do well naturally. Skills that come easily. These are gifts.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

What do others compliment you on? What have you accomplished? What values do you embody?

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You have many strengths. Perhaps you dismissed them. But they are real. They are enough.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The scripture says every man has his proper gift of God. Your gifts are yours. Comparing them is pointless.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

From now on, acknowledge your strengths without apology. When someone compliments you, say thank you.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Remind yourself of your strengths regularly. When facing challenges, consider what strengths you can bring.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One... beginning to return.
Two... feeling capable and gifted.
Three... becoming alert.
Four... refreshed and empowered.
Five... eyes open, fully alert. You know your strengths, Austin. Use them.
