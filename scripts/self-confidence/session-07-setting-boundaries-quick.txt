=== PRE-TALK / SETTLING (1-2 minutes) ===

Welcome back, Austin. Today we learn to set boundaries. Confident people know where they end and others begin. They say no without guilt and yes with freedom.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Without boundaries, you become depleted. With them, you preserve energy for what truly matters.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Today, you will learn to recognize, communicate, and maintain healthy boundaries.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== INDUCTION - Rapid Relaxation (5-6 minutes) ===

Take a deep diaphragmatic breath. Belly breathing... belly expands in, sinks down out.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Breathe in through your nose... belly rising... and release. Feel your sense of self becoming clearer.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Another breath... and as you exhale, allow your eyes to close.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let your neck become loose like rubber bands. Head floating. Jaws sagging. Complete facial relaxation.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Arms and hands becoming limp, loose, and heavy. Like lead weights. Legs and feet the same.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The better you feel, the deeper you go. The deeper you go, the better you feel.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your eyelids so relaxed they've become gently stuck together. This heaviness is self-respect.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== DEEPENING (3-4 minutes) ===

Imagine a garden representing your life with a fence around it. Inside is your space. Ten steps to the center where your boundaries become clear.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Ten. The garden is beautiful.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Nine. You see the fence that defines your space.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Eight. You understand what belongs inside.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Seven. What belongs outside becomes clear.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Six. Your sense of self strengthening.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Five. You control who enters through the gate.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Four. Your right to have boundaries becoming clear.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Three. Self-respect growing.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Two. Almost there.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

One. You stand in the center. Your boundaries are clear.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== THERAPEUTIC CONTENT (8-10 minutes) ===

Receive only what serves you. Your subconscious mind will accept what is true for you and let the rest go.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

--- Why Boundaries Matter ---

Austin, boundaries are not selfish. They are necessary. They allow you to show up fully present, giving from abundance rather than scarcity.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Boundaries create honest relationships. Clear limits mean less confusion, less resentment.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

--- Permission to Have Boundaries ---

The Savior Himself set boundaries. He withdrew to pray. He said no to demands that did not serve His mission. If He could set boundaries, so can you.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You are not required to meet every need presented to you. You have the right to protect your time and energy.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

--- Recognizing the Need ---

Your body often knows first. Notice feelings of tightness, resentment, dread. Notice the inner "no" even as your mouth says "yes." These signals indicate a boundary is needed.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

--- Setting the Boundary ---

Be clear about what the boundary is. Communicate simply: "I can't do that." "That doesn't work for me." "I need to decline."

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Be kind without being weak. You don't need to over-explain. A simple "no" is a complete sentence.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

--- Handling Pushback ---

Others may be disappointed. That doesn't mean your boundary is wrong. You can disappoint people without losing your worth.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Repeat calmly without escalating: "I understand. I still can't do that."

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

--- The Guilt ---

Guilt when saying no is often an old habit, not a moral guide. Acknowledge it and act anyway. The guilt decreases with practice.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

--- Direct Suggestions ---

From this day forward, you recognize when a boundary is needed. You trust the signals.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You communicate boundaries clearly and kindly. You maintain them despite pushback.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The guilt decreases over time. Saying no to one thing is saying yes to something else.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

--- Strengthening the Anchor ---

Press your thumb and ring finger together now.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Feel worth, trust, body, voice, strengths, and resilience flowing in. Add the clarity of healthy boundaries. The right to protect your space. The freedom to say no.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Release. The anchor now carries seven elements.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

--- Future Pacing ---

See yourself tomorrow setting a boundary you need. You communicate it simply and kindly. You feel more self-respect, not less.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

A week from now, you have set several boundaries and feel more energy.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

A month from now, healthy boundaries are natural. You have reclaimed your space.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== POST-HYPNOTIC SUGGESTIONS (1 minute) ===

Your boundary-setting skills continue to strengthen. You trust the signals and act on them.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Boundaries are not selfish. They are necessary for your well-being.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== EMERGENCE (2-3 minutes) ===

Time to return. The garden and its fence stay with you.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

One. Beginning to return. The garden remains with you.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Two. Becoming aware of your body. Relaxed and at peace.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Three. Feeling boundaried. Free. Clear.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Four. Energy returning. Mind sharp and self-respecting.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Five. Eyes open, fully awake, able to set healthy boundaries.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Welcome back, Austin. You have the right to protect your time and energy. Honor your limits. Say no when needed.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

You are boundaried. You are free. Go now, and protect your garden.
