Duration: ~28 minutes
Voice: Male, British accent, calm and affirming

[BEGIN SCRIPT]

Welcome back, Austin. Today we learn to set boundaries. Confident people know where they end and others begin. You will say no without guilt.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Take a deep breath in... hold... and release, feeling your own space.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Another breath, deeper... honoring your limits... hold... and release.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One more breath... eyes closing, sense of self strengthening.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let the golden light clarify your boundaries. Head to toe. Your sense of where you end becoming clear.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Descend now. Ten to one. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Complete boundary awareness.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Boundaries are not selfish. They are necessary. Without them, you are depleted. With them, you preserve energy for what matters.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Confident people say no without excessive explanation or guilt. Saying no to one thing is saying yes to something else.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The Savior set boundaries. He withdrew to pray. He said no to demands that did not serve His mission. You are allowed to be selective too.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Think of a situation where you need to say no. What specifically will you say? Keep it simple. Keep it clear.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Notice any guilt. It is a habit, not a signal you are wrong. Acknowledge it and act anyway.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Say the boundary: I cannot. I will not. That does not work for me. Feel the relief.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Boundaries can be set kindly. I appreciate the offer, but I cannot.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Others may not like your boundaries. That is okay. Your worth does not depend on their approval.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One... beginning to return.
Two... feeling boundaried and free.
Three... becoming alert.
Four... refreshed and self-respecting.
Five... eyes open, fully alert. Your boundaries are clear, Austin. Honor them.
