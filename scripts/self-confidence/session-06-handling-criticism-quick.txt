Duration: ~28 minutes
Voice: Male, British accent, calm and affirming

[BEGIN SCRIPT]

Welcome back, Austin. Today we learn to handle criticism. Fear of criticism undermines confidence. By changing your response, you become unshakeable.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Take a deep breath in... hold... and release, building inner resilience.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Another breath, deeper... releasing sensitivity to criticism... hold... and release.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One more breath... eyes closing, resilience deepening.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let the golden light create a protective shield. Head to toe. External opinions losing their power.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Descend now. Ten to one. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Complete protection.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Criticism is painful when we believe worth depends on approval. But your worth is inherent. No criticism changes it.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Separate useful feedback from destructive criticism. Ask: Is this person trustworthy? Is this specific and actionable? Offered with care?

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

If criticism is vague, mean-spirited, or unreliable, release it. Not all criticism deserves attention.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Even useful criticism is about behavior, not identity. I made a mistake is different from I am a mistake.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The Savior was criticized constantly. Yet He never wavered. He knew who He was.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When criticism comes, breathe. Do not react immediately. Is there truth to learn? Extract the lesson. Is it about behavior you can change, or your fundamental worth?

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

If criticism is unfair, release it. That is their opinion, not my reality.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Press your worth anchor when criticized. Your worth is inherent. Criticism cannot change it.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One... beginning to return.
Two... feeling strong and protected.
Three... becoming alert.
Four... refreshed and resilient.
Five... eyes open, fully alert. Criticism cannot shake you, Austin.
