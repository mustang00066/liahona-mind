Duration: ~38 minutes
Voice: Male, British accent, calm and affirming

[BEGIN SCRIPT]

Welcome back, Austin. Today we embrace your strengths. Too often we focus on weaknesses and forget what we do well. You will learn to see and own your gifts.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Find your comfortable position. Take a deep breath in... hold gently... and release, opening to see yourself clearly.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Another breath, deeper... releasing false humility... hold... and release, readying to acknowledge your gifts.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

One more breath... breathing in honest self-awareness... hold... and as you exhale, let your eyes close and see yourself truly.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let the golden light of clarity begin at your head. This light illuminates strengths. Scalp warming. Your true capabilities coming into view.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The warmth flows through your body. Each area touched is recognized for what it can do. Your hands, capable. Your mind, intelligent. Your heart, compassionate.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Now the staircase. Twenty steps down to full awareness of your strengths.

Twenty, nineteen, eighteen, seventeen, sixteen... clarity increasing.
Fifteen, fourteen, thirteen, twelve, eleven... strengths emerging.
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six... gifts becoming visible.
Five, four, three, two, one... complete awareness achieved.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

You are in a place of honest self-seeing. Here, false modesty falls away. Here, you see yourself as God sees you—strengths and all.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

We are often taught to downplay our abilities. But true humility is not pretending to be less than you are. True humility is knowing your strengths come from God and using them gratefully.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The parable of the talents teaches this. Those who recognized and used their gifts were praised. The one who buried his gift was rebuked. Your strengths are meant to be acknowledged and deployed.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

What are your strengths, Austin? Let us explore. First, think of things you do well naturally. Skills that come easily. These are gifts.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Perhaps you are good with people. Perhaps with ideas. Perhaps with your hands. Perhaps with systems. Perhaps with words. Perhaps with care. What comes naturally to you?

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Now think of what others compliment you on. When people praise you, what do they mention? These observations reflect real strengths, even if you discount them.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Now think of what you have accomplished. Challenges you have overcome. Goals you have reached. What do these achievements reveal about your abilities?

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Now think of values you embody. Are you honest? Kind? Persistent? Creative? Loyal? These character strengths are as real as skills.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You have many strengths. Perhaps you have not acknowledged them. Perhaps you dismissed them as not special or not enough. But they are special. They are enough.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The scripture says every man has his proper gift of God, one after this manner, and another after that. Your gifts are your gifts. Comparing them to others is pointless.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

From now on, you will acknowledge your strengths without apology. Not arrogantly, but honestly. When someone compliments you, you will say thank you, not argue.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You will remind yourself of your strengths regularly. Perhaps a list you write and read. Confidence grows when you remember what you can do.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When facing challenges, you will consider what strengths you can bring. Instead of focusing on what you lack, you will leverage what you have.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your strengths are tools. Use them. Develop them. Be grateful for them. They are how you contribute to the world.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Rest in awareness of your strengths now. You are capable. You have gifts. Let this knowledge settle deep.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

It is time to return. As I count from one to ten, you will become alert, carrying awareness of your strengths with you.

One... beginning to return.
Two... feeling capable and gifted.
Three... becoming more aware.
Four... refreshed and empowered.
Five... halfway back.
Six... alertness increasing.
Seven... feeling wonderful.
Eight... almost there.
Nine... nearly fully awake.
Ten... eyes open, fully alert. You know your strengths now, Austin. Use them.
