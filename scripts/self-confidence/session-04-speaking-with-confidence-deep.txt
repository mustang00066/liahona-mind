=== PRE-TALK / SETTLING (2-3 minutes) ===

Welcome back, Austin. In our previous sessions, you discovered your worth, released self-doubt, and learned to use your body as a source of confidence. Today, we address something that challenges many people: speaking with confidence.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Many people feel confident... until they have to speak. Whether it's a presentation, a meeting, a difficult conversation, or simply expressing an opinion, their confidence evaporates the moment they open their mouth.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

But here's what you need to understand: confident speaking is a skill, not a gift. It can be learned. It can be practiced. And today, you will begin installing the patterns of confident speech directly into your subconscious mind.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your voice is meant to be heard. Your thoughts deserve expression. By the end of this session, you will know, at a deep level, how to speak with clarity, assurance, and presence.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Find your comfortable position now. Allow yourself to settle. Your voice is about to become one of your greatest assets.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== INDUCTION - Eye Fatigue and Diaphragmatic Breathing (10-12 minutes) ===

Before we close your eyes, find a spot above your natural line of sight. Perhaps on the ceiling, perhaps high on the wall ahead. Focus your eyes on that spot now.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Notice how this upward gaze begins to tire your eye muscles. The small muscles holding your eyes in position are working... and becoming fatigued. Let this tiredness come. It is the gateway to deep relaxation and enhanced learning.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

As you maintain this gaze, begin your diaphragmatic breathing. Belly breathing... when you breathe in, your belly expands outward. When you breathe out, your belly button sinks back toward your spine.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This is the same breathing that supports confident speech. The diaphragm is the engine of your voice. Breathe in deeply through your nose... let your belly rise... hold for a moment... and release slowly through your mouth. Feel your voice supported by deep breath.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

Take another deep belly breath. Your eyes still focused upward... becoming heavier... more tired with each moment. Breathe in... belly expanding... hold... and release, feeling your throat relaxing, your voice preparing.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

One more breath. And as you exhale this time, allow your eyes to close. Let them fall shut with relief. Feel the comfort of this focused state, where your subconscious mind is open to learning new patterns of confident expression.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Now imagine your neck has become like a bundle of loose rubber bands. All tension dissolving. Your head floating gently... like a helium balloon... supported without any effort.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Allow your jaws to sag. Let your mouth open slightly. Your tongue resting loosely. Complete relaxation of all the muscles you use for speaking. Relaxed now, so they can be ready when needed.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let your shoulders sag completely. Perhaps you've been holding tension there before speaking... let it fall away. Your shoulders dropping... dropping... as low as they can go.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

Your arms and hands becoming limp, loose, and heavy. So limp, so loose, so heavy with relaxation... like heavy lead weights. So heavy it would take too much effort to lift them.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

Your legs and feet now. Let them go limp, loose, and heavy. Complete surrender to relaxation. Complete letting go.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

The better you feel, the deeper you go. And the deeper you go, the better you feel. A beautiful spiral of deepening peace and growing confidence.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Your eyelids now... so relaxed they've become wonderfully heavy. As though gently stuck together. The harder you might try to open them, the more they want to stay closed. This heaviness is comfort. This heaviness is readiness.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

=== DEEPENING (8-10 minutes) ===

Now let's go deeper. Imagine yourself backstage at a great theater. This is the theater of your voice. Soon you will step onto the stage, but first, you must go deeper into preparation.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

A spiral staircase leads twenty steps down to the stage level. With each step, you become more ready, more confident, more prepared to speak with power.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Twenty. You take the first step. Your feet on solid ground.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Nineteen. Another step. Your breath deepening.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Eighteen. Deeper now. Your voice warming inside you.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Seventeen. Your throat opening, ready.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Fifteen. Halfway there. Your diaphragm strong and supportive.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Two. One more step.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

One. You stand backstage, ready to step into your confident speaking voice.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

=== THERAPEUTIC CONTENT (15-18 minutes) ===

You remain in complete control. Your deeper mind will accept only the suggestions that align with your values and serve your growth. Everything else simply fades away.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

--- The Elements of Confident Speech ---

Austin, let's examine what confident speaking actually sounds like. Not aggressive. Not loud. Just clear, measured, and assured.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

First, there is pace. Anxious speakers rush. They hurry through their words as if trying to finish before something bad happens. But confident speakers take their time. They speak at a measured pace, allowing each word to land, each thought to be fully expressed.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

When you speak slowly, several things happen. Your words become clearer. Your thoughts organize better. Your audience has time to absorb what you're saying. And you appear more authoritative, more in control.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

From this moment forward, you naturally slow your speaking pace. Not unnaturally slow, but measured. Deliberate. You trust that people will wait for your words. They will.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

Second, there is volume. Anxious speakers mumble. They trail off at the end of sentences. They speak as if apologizing for taking up auditory space. But confident speakers project. Not shouting... projecting. Every word audible, clear, reaching its intended audience.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Projection comes from your diaphragm, not your throat. The breath you practiced earlier supports your voice, giving it resonance and carrying power. When you speak from your core, your voice naturally fills the space without strain.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

From this moment forward, you project your voice appropriately for each setting. Your words are always audible. You never trail off or mumble. You speak to be heard, and you are heard.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

Third, there are pauses. Anxious speakers fill every moment with sound. They use "um," "uh," "like," "you know," rather than allow any silence. They fear that silence means they've lost their audience. But confident speakers know that pauses are powerful.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

A pause after an important point lets it land. A pause before speaking shows you're thinking. A pause in the middle of a thought creates emphasis. Silence is not the enemy of confident speech... it is a tool.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

From this moment forward, you embrace pauses. You use them deliberately. When you might have said "um," you simply pause briefly. This makes you appear more thoughtful, more confident, more in command of your message.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

Fourth, there is pitch and inflection. Anxious speakers often raise their pitch at the end of statements, turning everything into a question. "My name is... Austin?" This is called "upspeak," and it undermines your authority. It sounds as though you're seeking approval for every statement.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Confident speakers let their pitch drop slightly at the end of statements. Statements sound like statements. Declarative. Certain. "My name is Austin." Period. No question mark.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

From this moment forward, you notice your pitch patterns. You let statements end as statements, with level or slightly dropping pitch. Questions can rise. Statements land firmly.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

Fifth, there is eye contact. Anxious speakers look down, look away, or scan constantly. They cannot hold another person's gaze. But confident speakers make direct, comfortable eye contact. Not staring aggressively... but connecting. Looking at the person they're addressing.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

When speaking to a group, confident speakers move their gaze, connecting with different people, making each one feel addressed. When speaking one-on-one, they maintain comfortable eye contact, looking away occasionally but always returning.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

From this moment forward, you make comfortable eye contact when speaking. You connect with your audience, whether one person or many. Your eyes support your voice.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

--- Mental Rehearsal ---

Now, Austin, let us practice. Imagine you are about to speak in an important situation. Perhaps a meeting. Perhaps a presentation. Perhaps a difficult conversation. Whatever situation challenges you most.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

First, before speaking, you center yourself. You take a deep diaphragmatic breath. You feel your feet on the ground. You assume a confident posture... shoulders back, chest open, head high.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Now, you begin to speak. Imagine your voice coming out slowly, deliberately. Each word clear. Each thought complete before the next begins.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Hear your voice projecting appropriately. Not shouting, but audible. Every word landing. Every sentence complete.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Notice yourself pausing between thoughts. Comfortable with silence. Using pauses for emphasis, for thought, for connection.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Hear your pitch staying level or dropping at the end of statements. Confident declarations. No upspeak. No seeking approval.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

See yourself making eye contact. Connecting with your audience. Confident. Present. Engaged.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

This is you speaking with confidence. This is the natural way your voice can work. You have just rehearsed it in your mind, and now your subconscious knows what to do.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

--- The Scripture Connection ---

The Savior promised His disciples that when they were brought before councils and rulers, they should "take no thought beforehand what ye shall speak... for it is not ye that speak, but the Holy Ghost."

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

There is profound wisdom here for confident speaking. When you over-prepare, when you try to script every word, when you take too much thought beforehand, you create rigidity and fear. But when you trust that the words will come when needed, you speak from a deeper place.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

This doesn't mean you don't prepare. You know your material. You understand your topic. But you trust that in the moment of speaking, the right words will flow. You trust your voice. You trust yourself.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Like Peter stepping out of the boat, confident speaking requires a moment of trust. You step forward, open your mouth, and trust that the words will be there. And they are. They always are.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

--- Direct Suggestions for Confident Speaking ---

Austin, receive these suggestions now into the deepest part of your being.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

From this day forward, you speak at a measured pace. You do not rush. You trust that your audience will wait for your words, and they do.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Your voice projects appropriately in every situation. You speak to be heard. You never mumble or trail off. Your words land.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

You embrace pauses. You use them deliberately. Where you might have said "um," you simply pause. This makes you appear thoughtful and confident.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Your pitch patterns support your confidence. Statements end as statements. Your voice conveys certainty.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

You make comfortable eye contact when speaking. You connect with your audience. Your eyes and voice work together.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Before important speaking situations, you prepare mentally. You breathe deeply, center yourself, and trust that the words will come. And they do.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

--- Strengthening the Anchor ---

Press your thumb and ring finger together now.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Feel your worth and self-trust flowing in from previous sessions. Now add to it: the power of your confident voice. The clarity of your speech. The calm assurance that your words deserve to be heard.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Your anchor now carries worth, trust, physical confidence, and vocal confidence. When you need to speak with assurance, press thumb to ring finger. Feel all four truths: "I am worthy. I trust myself. My body shows confidence. My voice is confident."

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Release. The anchor is reinforced.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

--- Future Pacing ---

See yourself tomorrow in a situation where you need to speak. Perhaps a meeting, a conversation, a presentation. Watch yourself breathe deeply, center yourself, and begin to speak.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Notice your measured pace. Your projecting voice. Your strategic pauses. Your confident pitch. Your connecting eye contact. You are speaking with confidence. Others are listening closely.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

A week from now, confident speaking is becoming natural. You don't have to think about it as much. Your subconscious has learned the patterns. They're becoming automatic.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

A month from now, people notice something different about how you speak. You seem more authoritative. More present. More certain. Your voice has become an asset. Others listen when you speak.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

=== POST-HYPNOTIC SUGGESTIONS (2-3 minutes) ===

The patterns of confident speaking you've learned today continue to deepen. Each time you speak, the patterns become stronger, more automatic, more natural.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You find yourself naturally slowing down, projecting appropriately, using pauses effectively. These are not things you have to remember... they become part of how you speak.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your anchor is always available. Before important speaking situations, press thumb to ring finger. Feel your worth, your self-trust, your physical confidence, and your vocal confidence all flowing together.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Remember: your voice deserves to be heard. Your thoughts have value. When you speak, you are sharing something worthwhile. Speak, and be heard.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== EMERGENCE (3-5 minutes) ===

It's time now to return to full waking consciousness. But the confident speaking patterns stay with you. They are now part of your subconscious communication system.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

As I count from one to ten, you'll become gradually more alert, more awake, more refreshed... and more ready to speak with confidence.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One. Beginning to return. Your voice feels centered and ready.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Two. Becoming aware of your body... so relaxed... so at peace.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Three. Feeling articulate. Feeling clear. Feeling confident.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Six. More alert now. Your throat open and ready.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Seven. Feeling wonderful. Feeling expressive. Feeling assured.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Eight. Almost there. Taking a deep, refreshing breath.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Nine. Ready to open your eyes, ready to speak with confidence.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Ten. Eyes open, fully awake, completely alert, and vocally confident.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Welcome back, Austin. Take a moment to notice how you feel. Notice the readiness in your voice. The clarity in your mind. The confidence in your expression.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Remember: your voice deserves to be heard. Speak slowly. Project clearly. Embrace pauses. Let statements be statements. Make eye contact. Trust that the words will come.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

They will. They always will. Go now, and speak with confidence.
