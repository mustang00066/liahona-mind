Duration: ~38 minutes

[BEGIN SCRIPT]

Welcome back, Austin. Today we focus on your voice. Many people feel confident until they have to speak. You will learn to express yourself with assurance.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Find your comfortable position. Take a deep breath in... hold gently... and release, feeling your voice ready to be heard.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Another breath, deeper... breathing into your throat and chest... hold... and release, your voice warming.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

One more breath... breathing in the power to speak... hold... and as you exhale, let your eyes close and your voice center itself.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let the golden light begin at your head. This light empowers speech. Scalp warming. Brain organizing thoughts clearly.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The warmth flows into your throat, the seat of your voice. Feel it warming, opening, relaxing. Your voice is preparing to be confident.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Down through your chest, where your breath supports your words. Through your diaphragm, the engine of strong speech. Your whole speaking system is aligning.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Now the staircase. Twenty steps down to confident speech.

Twenty, nineteen, eighteen, seventeen, sixteen... voice strengthening.
Fifteen, fourteen, thirteen, twelve, eleven... words flowing easily.
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six... fear of speaking fading.
Five, four, three, two, one... complete vocal confidence achieved.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

You are in a place of expressive freedom. Here, words come easily. Here, you trust your voice.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Confident speech has several qualities. First, pace. Confident speakers do not rush. They speak at a measured pace, allowing their words to land.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Second, volume. Confident speakers are audible. They do not mumble or trail off. They project, not loudly, but clearly.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Third, pauses. Confident speakers are not afraid of silence. They pause between thoughts. These pauses show comfort, not uncertainty.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Fourth, pitch. Anxious voices rise at the end, making statements sound like questions. Confident voices stay level or drop slightly at the end. Statements sound like statements.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Fifth, filler words. Confident speakers minimize um, uh, like, you know. They replace these with brief pauses. Silence is better than filler.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let us practice now. In your mind, think of something you would like to say. Perhaps introducing yourself. Perhaps sharing an opinion. Just a few sentences.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Now, imagine speaking these words slowly. Not rushing. Taking your time.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Imagine your voice clear and audible. Not shouting, but heard. Every word landing.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Imagine pausing between sentences. Comfortable silence. Then continuing.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Imagine your voice staying level at the end of statements. Confident. Certain.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This is confident speech. It is not about being loud or aggressive. It is about being clear, measured, and sure.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The scripture promises that the Lord will give you words in the moment you need them. Take no thought beforehand what ye shall speak. Trust that your voice will serve you.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

From now on, before speaking in important situations, you will take a breath. You will center yourself. You will speak slowly, clearly, and with assurance.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

If you feel nervous, press your worth anchor. Remind yourself that your voice deserves to be heard. Your thoughts have value. Speak them.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

With practice, confident speech becomes natural. Your default way of communicating becomes clear and assured. Others notice. They listen more closely.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Rest in vocal confidence now. Your voice is ready to serve you. It knows how to be clear, how to be heard, how to convey confidence.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

It is time to return. As I count from one to ten, you will become alert, carrying vocal confidence with you.

One... beginning to return.
Two... feeling articulate and clear.
Three... becoming more aware.
Four... refreshed and expressive.
Five... halfway back.
Six... alertness increasing.
Seven... feeling wonderful.
Eight... almost there.
Nine... nearly fully awake.
Ten... eyes open, fully alert. Your voice is confident now, Austin. Speak and be heard.
