Voice: Male, British accent, calm and affirming

[BEGIN SCRIPT]

Welcome, Austin. You have come seeking confidence. True confidence begins with knowing your worth. Today, you discover that your worth is already assured.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Take a deep breath in... hold... and release, already feeling valued.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Another breath, deeper... breathing in worthiness... hold... and release.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One more breath... eyes closing, receiving truth about yourself.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let golden light carry the truth of your worth. Head to toe. Self-doubt dissolving. Value emerging.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Descend now. Ten to one. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Deep knowing achieved.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Here is the truth: your worth is inherent. You did not earn it. You cannot lose it. It exists because you exist.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The scripture teaches, The worth of souls is great in the sight of God. Your worth is declared by your Creator. No one can revoke it.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You are a child of God. You carry divine heritage. There is divinity within you.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The world measures worth by achievements and approval. These measures are false. Your worth existed before you accomplished anything.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Worth is not a competition. Your worth does not diminish anyone else's, and theirs does not diminish yours.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let us create a worth anchor. Press your thumb and ring finger together.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Feel the truth flowing in. You are valuable. You matter. You are enough.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Release. The anchor is set. When you press thumb to ring finger, your worth becomes undeniable.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Rest in this truth. You are worthy. Not because you are perfect. Because you are.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One... beginning to return.
Two... feeling worthy and grounded.
Three... becoming alert.
Four... refreshed and confident.
Five... eyes open, fully alert. You know your worth now, Austin.
