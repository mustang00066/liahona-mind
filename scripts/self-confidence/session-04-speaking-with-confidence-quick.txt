=== PRE-TALK / SETTLING (1-2 minutes) ===

Welcome back, Austin. Today we focus on your voice. Many people feel confident until they have to speak. Then confidence vanishes.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Confident speaking is a skill, not a gift. It can be learned. Today, you will install patterns of confident speech directly into your subconscious.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Your voice is meant to be heard. By the end of this session, you will know how to speak with clarity and presence.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== INDUCTION - Rapid Relaxation (5-6 minutes) ===

Take a deep diaphragmatic breath. Belly breathing... belly expands in, sinks down out. This breath is the same breath that supports confident speech.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Breathe in through your nose... belly rising... and release. Feel your voice preparing, supported by deep breath.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Another breath... and as you exhale, allow your eyes to close.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let your neck become loose like rubber bands. Head floating. Jaws sagging. Your tongue resting loosely. All the muscles for speaking, relaxed now.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Arms and hands becoming limp, loose, and heavy. Like lead weights. Legs and feet the same.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The better you feel, the deeper you go. The deeper you go, the better you feel.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your eyelids so relaxed they've become gently stuck together. This heaviness is readiness.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== DEEPENING (3-4 minutes) ===

Imagine standing backstage at a theater of your voice. Ten steps down to the stage where confident speech awaits.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Ten. Your feet on solid ground.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Nine. Your breath deepening.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Eight. Your voice warming inside you.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Seven. Throat opening, ready.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Six. Fear of speaking dissolving.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Five. Diaphragm strong and supportive.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Four. Mind organizing thoughts clearly.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Three. Words flowing easily.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Two. Almost there.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

One. You stand ready, prepared to speak with confidence.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== THERAPEUTIC CONTENT (8-10 minutes) ===

--- Elements of Confident Speech ---

Austin, confident speaking has five key elements.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

First, pace. Confident speakers do not rush. They speak at a measured pace, allowing each word to land. From now on, you naturally slow your speaking pace. People will wait for your words.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Second, volume. Confident speakers project. Not shouting, but audible. Projection comes from your diaphragm, not your throat. From now on, you speak to be heard. You never mumble or trail off.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Third, pauses. Confident speakers use silence as a tool. A pause after an important point lets it land. When you might say "um," simply pause. This makes you appear thoughtful and confident.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Fourth, pitch. Confident speakers let pitch drop slightly at statements' end. Statements sound like statements. No upspeak. No seeking approval. From now on, your statements land firmly.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Fifth, eye contact. Confident speakers connect visually. Not staring aggressively, but meeting the world directly. From now on, you make comfortable eye contact when speaking.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Mental Rehearsal ---

Imagine speaking in an important situation. Before speaking, you take a deep breath. You assume confident posture... shoulders back, chest open, head high.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You begin to speak. Your voice comes out slowly, deliberately. Each word clear. You pause between thoughts. Comfortable with silence.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your pitch stays level at statement ends. You make eye contact. You are speaking with confidence. Others are listening closely.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

--- Scripture Wisdom ---

The Savior promised: "Take no thought beforehand what ye shall speak." Over-preparing creates rigidity. Trust that in the moment, the right words will flow.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Like Peter stepping from the boat, confident speaking requires trust. You open your mouth and trust the words will be there. They always are.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

--- Direct Suggestions ---

From this day forward, you speak at a measured pace. You do not rush. Your audience waits for your words.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your voice projects appropriately. You speak to be heard. Your words land.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You embrace pauses. You use them deliberately. Silence replaces filler words.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your pitch conveys certainty. Statements are statements. Questions are questions.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You make comfortable eye contact. Your eyes and voice work together.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

--- Strengthening the Anchor ---

Press your thumb and ring finger together now.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Feel worth, trust, and body confidence flowing in. Add vocal confidence. The power of your clear voice. The calm assurance that your words deserve to be heard.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Release. The anchor is reinforced.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

--- Future Pacing ---

See yourself tomorrow speaking in an important situation. You breathe, center yourself, and speak with measured pace, projecting voice, strategic pauses, confident pitch.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

A week from now, confident speaking is becoming natural. Your subconscious has learned the patterns.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

A month from now, people notice how you speak. More authoritative. More present. Your voice has become an asset.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== POST-HYPNOTIC SUGGESTIONS (1 minute) ===

The patterns of confident speaking continue to deepen. Each time you speak, they become more automatic.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Your anchor is always available. Before important speaking, press thumb to ring finger. Feel all your confidence flowing together.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== EMERGENCE (2-3 minutes) ===

Time to return. The confident speaking patterns stay with you, part of your subconscious communication.

One. Beginning to return. Voice centered and ready.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]
