=== PRE-TALK / SETTLING (1-2 minutes) ===

Welcome back, Austin. This is our final session. You have come a long way. Today we integrate everything you have learned into a unified, permanent confidence.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Over eight sessions, you discovered your worth, released doubt, developed body and voice confidence, embraced strengths, learned to handle criticism, and set boundaries. These form a complete system.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Today we weave them together permanently. You are no longer becoming confident. You are confident.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== INDUCTION - Rapid Relaxation (5-6 minutes) ===

Take a deep diaphragmatic breath. Belly breathing... belly expands in, sinks down out.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Breathe in through your nose... belly rising... and release. This familiar process works quickly now.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Another breath... and as you exhale, allow your eyes to close.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let your neck become loose like rubber bands. Head floating. Jaws sagging. Complete facial relaxation.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Arms and hands becoming limp, loose, and heavy. Like lead weights. Legs and feet the same.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The better you feel, the deeper you go. The deeper you go, the better you feel.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your eyelids so relaxed they've become gently stuck together. This heaviness is integration.
