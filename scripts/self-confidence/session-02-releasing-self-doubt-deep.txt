SELF CONFIDENCE - SESSION 2: Releasing Self-Doubt (DEEP VERSION)
Duration: ~38 minutes
Voice: Male, British accent, calm and affirming

[BEGIN SCRIPT]

Welcome back, Austin. Today we release self-doubt. That voice that whispers you cannot, you are not enough, who do you think you are. You will learn to quiet it forever.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Find your comfortable position. Take a deep breath in... hold gently... and release, beginning to loosen doubt's grip.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Another breath, deeper... breathing out uncertainty... hold... and release, self-belief growing.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

One more breath... breathing in confidence... hold... and as you exhale, let your eyes close and doubt begin to fade.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let the golden light of certainty begin at your head. This light dissolves doubt. Scalp warming. The questioning voice growing quiet. Self-assurance emerging.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The warmth flows through your face, your neck, your shoulders. Down through your body. Each area touched becomes more certain, more trusting of yourself.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Now the staircase. Twenty steps down to unshakeable self-belief.

Twenty, nineteen, eighteen, seventeen, sixteen... doubt loosening.
Fifteen, fourteen, thirteen, twelve, eleven... confidence building.
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six... self-trust deepening.
Five, four, three, two, one... complete self-belief achieved.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

You are in a place of absolute self-trust. Here, doubt cannot reach you. Here, you know who you are.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Self-doubt is not wisdom. It disguises itself as realistic thinking, but it is fear wearing a mask. True wisdom knows your strengths and limitations. Doubt only sees limitations.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Consider where your self-doubt came from. Perhaps criticism in childhood. Perhaps a failure that you generalized. Perhaps comparing yourself to others. These origins do not justify doubt's continued presence.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

What doubt says is not usually true. It says you cannot when you can. It says you will fail when you might succeed. It says you are not good enough when you are.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The Savior said to Peter, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt? Peter was walking on water until doubt made him sink. Doubt, not inability, was his problem.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Doubt is what makes you sink. Not your actual limitations. You are more capable than doubt allows you to see.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let us examine a specific doubt you carry. What does that voice say about you? I am not smart enough. I am not attractive enough. I am not talented enough. What is your doubt?

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Now, look at this doubt clearly. Is it absolutely true? Or is it fear? What evidence contradicts this doubt? What have you accomplished despite it?

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The doubt is not truth. It is a scared voice from your past. You can thank it for trying to protect you and let it go.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Say to the doubt: Thank you for trying to protect me. But you are not needed anymore. I trust myself now.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Feel the doubt loosening. It cannot survive examination. It cannot survive your refusal to believe it.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

From now on, when self-doubt speaks, you will recognize it immediately. You will say: That is doubt, not truth. Then you will question it. Then you will dismiss it.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Press your worth anchor now. Thumb to ring finger. Feel your worth flooding in. Doubt cannot coexist with knowing your worth.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Replace doubt with a new voice. I am capable. I can figure this out. I have what it takes. I trust myself. These are true statements. Repeat them until they feel natural.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Rest in self-trust now. The doubt is quiet. Perhaps for the first time in a long while, you simply believe in yourself. This is your natural state.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

It is time to return. As I count from one to ten, you will become alert, carrying self-trust with you.

One... beginning to return.
Two... feeling confident and capable.
Three... becoming more aware.
Four... refreshed and self-assured.
Five... halfway back.
Six... alertness increasing.
Seven... feeling wonderful.
Eight... almost there.
Nine... nearly fully awake.
Ten... eyes open, fully alert. Doubt has lost its power, Austin. You believe in yourself now.
