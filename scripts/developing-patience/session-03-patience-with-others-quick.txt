=== PRE-TALK / SETTLING (1-2 minutes) ===

Welcome back, Austin. Today we focus on something that tests patience daily: other people.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

People do not move at your pace. They have their own rhythms and struggles. But what if you could see others with compassion rather than frustration?

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Today you develop patience with others—your spouse, your children, coworkers, strangers. Let us begin.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== INDUCTION - Rapid Relaxation with Breathing (5-6 minutes) ===

Take a deep breath now. Diaphragmatic breathing—belly expanding as you breathe in, sinking as you breathe out.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Breathe in through your nose... belly rising gently... hold for a moment... and release. With this exhale, release any frustration you are carrying toward anyone.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Another breath... deeper... and as you exhale, allow your eyes to close naturally.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let your neck become loose like rubber bands. Head floating like a helium balloon. Jaws sagging. Shoulders dropping.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Arms becoming limp, loose, and heavy. All the way down to your hands.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Legs and feet the same. The better you feel, the deeper you go. Compassion developing.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Your eyelids becoming wonderfully heavy. As though gently stuck together. You are ready to understand others deeply.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== DEEPENING (3-4 minutes) ===

Imagine yourself at the top of a staircase... ten steps leading down to a place of deep understanding.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Ten. Stepping down. Compassion growing.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Nine. Deeper. Understanding developing.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Eight. Seeing others more clearly.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Seven. Deeper still.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Six. Halfway there.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Five. So deep. Heart opening.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Four. Almost there.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Three. Deep grace.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Two. One more step.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

One. You enter a place of understanding. Here, you can see others as struggling humans doing their best. Everything you hear will be absorbed completely.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== THERAPEUTIC CONTENT (8-10 minutes) ===

Receive only what serves you. Your subconscious mind will accept what is true for you and let the rest go.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

--- Everyone Has a Story ---

Everyone has a story. Everyone is carrying something.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The slow driver may be afraid. The rude clerk may have just received terrible news. When you are impatient, you see only behavior. But behind that behavior is a whole life.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Patience grows when you remember: I do not know their full story.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- The Golden Rule of Patience ---

Think of a time when you made a mistake. How did you want others to treat you? You wanted grace, not impatience.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The people around you want the same. When someone frustrates you, ask: "How would I want to be treated?" Then treat them that way.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Patience with Family ---

Your family deserves your best patience, not your leftovers. We are often more patient with strangers than with those we love most.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your spouse has their own struggles. Your children are learning—they will make mistakes.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Install this now: I will be most patient with those I love most.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Assuming Positive Intent ---

Assume positive intent. When someone does something frustrating, assume they are not trying to frustrate you.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Instead of: "They're so inconsiderate!"
Try: "They probably didn't realize."

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This assumption prevents frustration before it builds.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Anchor Reinforcement ---

Bring your hands together now, fingers interlaced.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

This anchor now carries patience with others—compassion, understanding, grace.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Say internally: "I see others with compassion. I give grace as I want to receive it."

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Release your hands.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== POST-HYPNOTIC SUGGESTIONS (1 minute) ===

When others frustrate you, you will remember they have a story.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

You will treat others as you would want to be treated. You will assume positive intent.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your family will receive your best. Patience with others is growing.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== EMERGENCE (2-3 minutes) ===

It is time to return to full awareness, bringing compassion with you.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

I will count from one to five. With each number, you become more alert while patience with others grows.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

One. Beginning to return. Compassion installed.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Two. Energy returning. Kind.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Three. Understanding deepened.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Four. Almost fully alert. Heart open.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Five. Eyes open, fully awake, completely alert, and filled with patience for others.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Welcome back, Austin. You are growing in compassion.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Remember: everyone has a story. Treat others as you would want to be treated. Your family especially will benefit from this growing patience.
