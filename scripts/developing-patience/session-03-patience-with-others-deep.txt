=== PRE-TALK / SETTLING (2-3 minutes) ===

Welcome back, Austin. You have learned to understand impatience and developed the pause practice. Today we focus on something that tests patience daily: other people.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

People do not move at your pace. They have their own rhythms, their own struggles, their own reasons for behaving as they do. And when their behavior does not match your expectations, impatience can flare.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

But what if you could see others with compassion rather than frustration? What if you could give them the same grace you hope they would give you?

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Today you will develop patience with others—your spouse, your children, coworkers, strangers. This kind of patience strengthens relationships and brings peace to your interactions.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Find a comfortable position. Let us begin.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== INDUCTION - Eye Fatigue with Diaphragmatic Breathing (10-12 minutes) ===

Begin by finding a spot on the ceiling or wall, slightly above your natural line of sight. A spot that requires you to look upward without straining your neck.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Focus on that spot. Keep your eyes fixed there as you begin to breathe deeply. Diaphragmatic breathing—belly expanding as you breathe in, sinking as you breathe out.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Breathe in through your nose... belly rising gently... hold for a moment... and release through your mouth. With this exhale, release any frustration you are carrying toward anyone.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Continue gazing at that spot. Notice how your eyes begin to feel. A slight strain. A heaviness developing. This is natural and welcome.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Another breath now... deeper than before... belly expanding... hold... and release. Feel compassion beginning to develop for the imperfect humans around you.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Keep your eyes on that spot. They are growing heavier. The muscles around your eyes are tiring.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Breathe in once more... letting the breath fill your entire chest cavity... hold... and as you exhale, notice your eyes wanting to close. When the desire becomes strong enough, allow them to close naturally.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

If your eyes have not yet closed, take another breath and let them close with the exhale.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Eyes now closed... feel the relief. In this peaceful state, you can understand others more deeply.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Now that your eyes are closed, bring your attention to your breathing. Allow each breath to deepen the relaxation flowing through your body.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

With your next breath, focus on your scalp. Feel it softening, relaxing. Any tension held there simply melting away.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

This warmth flows down to your forehead. Feel the muscles of your forehead smoothing out.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Down to your eyes now—those tired muscles resting deeply. Your eyelids becoming wonderfully heavy.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The relaxation spreads to your cheeks and jaw. Your jaw becoming slack.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Down into your neck. Feel each vertebra of your neck relaxing.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The wave of relaxation flows into your shoulders. Feel yours dropping now.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Down through your arms. The relaxation flowing through your upper arms... your elbows... your forearms. Into your wrists and hands.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Your chest now. Feel your breathing becoming even slower, even deeper.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The warmth spreads through your stomach. Any knots dissolving completely.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Into your lower back. Feel it softening.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Through your hips now. Down into your thighs. Completely limp, loose, and heavy.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Past your knees, into your calves. Resting now. Completely at peace.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Into your ankles, your feet, your toes. Every muscle, every cell bathed in deep relaxation.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

You are deeply relaxed, Austin. Your body is at peace. Your mind is calm and receptive. Ready to develop patience with others.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== DEEPENING - 20-Step Staircase (8-10 minutes) ===

In your mind's eye, you find yourself at the top of a beautiful staircase. This staircase has twenty steps, and it leads down to a place of deep understanding—where you can see others with the eyes of compassion.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The banister is smooth beneath your hand. The steps are solid and safe. With each step you descend, you will go deeper into hypnosis and closer to genuine patience with others.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Step twenty. Taking the first step down. Compassion growing.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step nineteen. Going deeper. Understanding developing.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step eighteen. Deeper still. Seeing others more clearly.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step seventeen. Every step takes you deeper. Every step brings more grace.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step sixteen. Mind quieting. Judgment dissolving.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step fifteen. Halfway there. So relaxed. Heart opening.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step fourteen. Deeper than before. Patience with others growing.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step eight. Going deeper still.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step seven. Profound compassion developing.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step five. So deep now. Completely ready.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step four. Deeper than you have ever been.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step three. The place of understanding is just ahead.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step two. One more step.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step one. You step into a place of deep understanding. Here, you can see others as they truly are—struggling humans doing their best. Everything you hear will be absorbed completely.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== THERAPEUTIC CONTENT (15-18 minutes) ===

--- Everyone Has a Story ---

In this place of understanding, you can see a truth that impatience hides: everyone has a story. Everyone is carrying something.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The slow driver may be elderly and afraid. The rude clerk may have just received terrible news. The friend who forgot may be overwhelmed with their own struggles.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When you are impatient with someone, you are seeing only their behavior. But behind that behavior is a whole life—childhood wounds, current stresses, fears, insecurities, hopes, and pains.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Patience grows when you remember: I do not know their full story. What I see is only a small part of who they are.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- The Golden Rule of Patience ---

You know the golden rule: do unto others as you would have them do unto you. Let us apply it to patience.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Think of a time when you were slow, distracted, or made a mistake. Perhaps you were tired, or stressed, or simply having a bad day.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

How did you want others to treat you? Did you want impatience, frustration, harsh words? Or did you want understanding, grace, a little room to be human?

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Of course you wanted grace. And so do the people around you.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When someone frustrates you, ask: "How would I want to be treated if I were in their situation?" Then treat them that way.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Patience with Family ---

Let us focus on those closest to you—your spouse, your children. These are often the people who test our patience most.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Why? Because we spend the most time with them. Because we have expectations of them. Because we are comfortable enough to let our guard down.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

But here is the irony: we are often more patient with strangers than with those we love most. We extend grace to the clerk but snap at our spouse. We smile at the neighbor's child but scold our own harshly.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This is backwards. Your family deserves your best patience, not your leftovers.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Think of your spouse. They have their own struggles, their own pace, their own way of doing things. What if you extended the same grace to them that you would want?

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Think of your children. They are learning. They are not small adults. They will make mistakes, spill things, forget things, move slowly. This is development, not defiance.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Install this now: I will be most patient with those I love most. My family will receive my best, not my worst.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- The Slow Down for Others Practice ---

Here is a practical technique for patience with others: consciously slow down to their pace.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When your child is walking slowly, match their pace. When your spouse is telling a story, let them take their time. When the elderly person is moving slowly, adjust yourself to them rather than expecting them to adjust to you.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This is a choice to value relationship over speed. To value the person over the task. To be present rather than rushing.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The pause practice helps here too. When you feel impatience rising, use your three-breath pause. Then consciously choose to slow down.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Assuming Positive Intent ---

Another powerful tool: assume positive intent. When someone does something frustrating, assume they are not trying to frustrate you.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Most people are not malicious. They are not thinking about you when they drive slowly or talk too long. They are just living their lives.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When you assume positive intent, you give people the benefit of the doubt. You interpret their behavior charitably rather than negatively.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Instead of: "They're so inconsiderate!"
Try: "They probably didn't realize. They're dealing with their own stuff."

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This assumption prevents frustration before it builds.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- The Savior's Example ---

Consider how the Savior treated people. He was surrounded by imperfect disciples who misunderstood Him constantly. They fell asleep when He needed them. They argued about who was greatest. They doubted after seeing miracles.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Yet He was patient with them. He taught them again and again. He forgave them. He saw their potential even when they did not live up to it.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This is the patience you are developing. Not tolerating others while secretly judging them. But genuinely seeing them with love, understanding their struggles, and extending grace.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Anchor Reinforcement ---

Bring your hands together now, fingers interlaced, reinforcing your patience anchor.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This anchor now carries patience with others. When you use it, you access compassion, understanding, and the ability to slow down.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Say internally: "I see others with compassion. I give grace as I want to receive it. I am patient with the people in my life."

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

This anchor is growing stronger.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Release your hands.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== POST-HYPNOTIC SUGGESTIONS (2-3 minutes) ===

Let this compassion sink deep into your subconscious mind now.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When others frustrate you, you will remember: they have a story. What you see is not the whole picture.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You will ask yourself: how would I want to be treated? And you will treat them that way.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You will be most patient with those you love most. Your family will receive your best.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You will assume positive intent. You will interpret others charitably.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Patience with others is growing in you. Relationships will flourish as a result.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== EMERGENCE (3-5 minutes) ===

It is time to return to full waking consciousness, bringing compassion with you.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

In a moment, I will count from one to ten. With each number, you will become more alert, more awake, while patience with others continues growing.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One. Beginning the journey back. Compassion installed.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Two. Feeling energy returning to your body. Kind.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Three. Understanding of others deepened.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Four. Your mind clearing. Your heart open.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Five. Halfway back now. Feeling gracious.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Six. More alert with each breath. Still compassionate.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Seven. Almost there. Ready to treat others well.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Eight. Eyes preparing to open. At peace.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Nine. Nearly fully awake. Taking a deep, refreshing breath.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Ten. Eyes open, fully alert, completely refreshed, and filled with patience for others.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Welcome back, Austin. You are growing in compassion.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Remember: everyone has a story. Treat others as you would want to be treated. Slow down to their pace. Assume positive intent.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Your family especially will benefit from this growing patience. Give them your best, not your leftovers.
