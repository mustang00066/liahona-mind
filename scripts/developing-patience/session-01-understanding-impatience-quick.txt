=== PRE-TALK / SETTLING (1-2 minutes) ===

Welcome, Austin. You are here because you recognize that impatience has been costing you. Today begins a journey toward developing true patience.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Patience is more than just waiting. It is how you wait—remaining calm when circumstances are not moving at your preferred pace. Treating others with kindness even when they frustrate you.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Today we understand impatience: where it comes from, what it costs you, and why patience is worth developing. Let us begin.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== INDUCTION - Rapid Relaxation with Breathing (5-6 minutes) ===

Take a deep breath now. Diaphragmatic breathing—belly expanding as you breathe in, sinking as you breathe out.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Breathe in through your nose... belly rising gently... hold for a moment... and release through your mouth. There is no rush here. Let each breath take its natural time.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Another breath... deeper... and as you exhale, allow your eyes to close naturally.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let your neck become loose like rubber bands. Head floating like a helium balloon. Jaws sagging. Shoulders dropping—releasing all tension from hurrying.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Arms becoming limp, loose, and heavy. All the way down to your hands.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Legs and feet the same. The better you feel, the deeper you go. No hurry here. Just rest.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Your eyelids becoming wonderfully heavy. As though gently stuck together. You are ready to understand impatience.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== DEEPENING (3-4 minutes) ===

Imagine yourself at the top of a staircase... ten steps leading down to a peaceful garden where time moves slowly.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Ten. Stepping down. Relaxation deepening.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Nine. Deeper. Rushing fading.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Eight. Time slowing down.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Seven. Deeper still.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Six. Halfway there.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Five. So deep. No hurry.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Four. Almost there.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Three. Deep peace.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Two. One more step.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

One. You enter the peaceful garden. Time moves slowly here. Everything you hear will be absorbed completely.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== THERAPEUTIC CONTENT (8-10 minutes) ===

--- What Is Impatience? ---

Impatience is a form of resistance—resistance to the present moment because it is not what you want.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Impatience says: "This should be happening faster. I should not have to wait." It is mentally arguing with reality. And that argument creates frustration and suffering.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- The Roots of Impatience ---

Where does impatience come from?

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

First, it is a HABIT. Your brain has been trained to expect speed. Instant downloads. Immediate responses. When the world does not match these expectations, frustration arises.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Second, it comes from a sense of SCARCITY. If you believe time is scarce, waiting feels like loss.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Third, it is the ILLUSION OF CONTROL. You believe your frustration will speed things up. But it rarely does.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Fourth, it may be connected to IDENTITY. "I'm just an impatient person." But identity can change.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- The Costs of Impatience ---

Impatience damages RELATIONSHIPS. People feel rushed, unvalued, like a burden.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Impatience damages your HEALTH. Chronic low-level stress wears you out.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Impatience damages DECISIONS. You rush and take shortcuts instead of the right option.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Impatience damages your PEACE. You cannot enjoy the journey because you are fixated on arrival.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- The Promise of Patience ---

Patience brings peace, stronger relationships, better outcomes, and reflects spiritual maturity.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

In the scriptures, patience is a fruit of the Spirit. When you develop patience, you become more like the Savior.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Installing Your Anchor ---

Bring your hands together, interlacing your fingers. Let them rest comfortably.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This is the posture of patience—waiting, at rest, not grasping or pushing.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Feel calm spreading through you. Say internally: "I have time. I can wait. I am at peace with this moment."

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Whenever impatience arises, bring your hands together this way. Calm and patience will activate.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Release your hands. The anchor is installed.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== POST-HYPNOTIC SUGGESTIONS (1 minute) ===

You will notice when impatience arises. This awareness is the first step.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

When impatience arises, you will use your anchor. Hands together, fingers interlaced. Calm will spread.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You are becoming a patient person. This identity is taking root.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== EMERGENCE (2-3 minutes) ===

It is time to return to full awareness, bringing your new understanding with you.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

I will count from one to five. With each number, you become more alert while patience develops.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

One. Beginning to return. Understanding planted.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Two. Energy returning. Calm energy.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Three. Your anchor installed.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Four. Almost fully alert. At peace.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Five. Eyes open, fully awake, completely alert, and beginning to develop patience.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Welcome back, Austin. You have taken the first step on a valuable journey.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

You understand impatience—its roots and costs. Your anchor is installed: hands together, patience activated.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Notice when impatience arises. Use your anchor. Remember: you have time. You can wait. Patience is developing in you.
