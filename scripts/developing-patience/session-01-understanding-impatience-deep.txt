=== PRE-TALK / SETTLING (2-3 minutes) ===

Welcome, Austin. You are here because you recognize that impatience has been costing you—in relationships, in peace of mind, in the quality of your daily experience. Today begins a journey toward developing true patience.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Patience is more than just waiting. It is how you wait. It is remaining calm and centered when circumstances are not moving at your preferred pace. It is treating others with kindness even when they frustrate you. It is giving yourself grace when growth takes longer than you hoped.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The world teaches us that faster is better, that waiting is wasted time, that we should have what we want now. But this is a recipe for constant frustration. Life rarely moves at the pace we prefer.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

In this series, you will develop genuine patience—not through gritting your teeth and enduring, but by transforming your relationship with time, with others, and with yourself.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Today we begin by understanding impatience: where it comes from, what it costs you, and why patience is worth developing. Find a comfortable position. Let us begin.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== INDUCTION - Eye Fatigue with Diaphragmatic Breathing (10-12 minutes) ===

Begin by finding a spot on the ceiling or wall, slightly above your natural line of sight. A spot that requires you to look upward without straining your neck.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Focus on that spot. Keep your eyes fixed there as you begin to breathe deeply. Diaphragmatic breathing—belly expanding as you breathe in, sinking as you breathe out.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Breathe in through your nose... belly rising gently... hold for a moment... and release through your mouth. There is no rush here. Let each breath take its natural time.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Continue gazing at that spot. Notice how your eyes begin to feel. A slight strain. A heaviness developing. This is natural and welcome. With each breath, this heaviness increases.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Another breath now... deeper than before... belly expanding... hold... and release. In this moment, there is nowhere else you need to be. Nothing else you need to do. Just breathe.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Keep your eyes on that spot. They are growing heavier. The muscles around your eyes are tiring. Some of you may notice a watering of the eyes. Others feel a pulling sensation. Both are signs that hypnosis is developing.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Breathe in once more... letting the breath fill your entire chest cavity... hold... and as you exhale, notice your eyes wanting to close. When the desire becomes strong enough, allow them to close naturally.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

If your eyes have not yet closed, take another breath and let them close with the exhale. There is no rush. Your eyes will close when they are ready. Patience even here.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Eyes now closed... feel the relief. The muscles that were straining are now resting. This is what patience feels like—allowing things to unfold in their own time rather than forcing.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Now that your eyes are closed, bring your attention to your breathing. Allow each breath to deepen the relaxation flowing through your body.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

With your next breath, focus on your scalp. Feel it softening, relaxing. Any tension held there simply melting away. Warmth spreading across the top of your head.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

This warmth flows down to your forehead. Feel the muscles of your forehead smoothing out. All worry lines dissolving. Your forehead becoming cool, calm, completely relaxed.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Down to your eyes now—those tired muscles resting deeply. Your eyelids becoming wonderfully heavy. As though tiny weights are gently pressing them down.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The relaxation spreads to your cheeks and jaw. Your jaw becoming slack. Your teeth parting slightly. All the tension that accumulates in your jaw throughout the day—released now.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Down into your neck. Feel each vertebra of your neck relaxing. The muscles on the sides and back of your neck becoming loose like warm rubber.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The wave of relaxation flows into your shoulders. Shoulders are where we carry so much tension from hurrying through life. Feel yours dropping now. Releasing their load. Becoming soft and heavy.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Down through your arms. The relaxation flowing like warm honey through your upper arms... your elbows... your forearms. Into your wrists and hands. Each finger becoming loose and heavy.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Your chest now. Feel your breathing becoming even slower, even deeper. Your heart beating calmly, steadily. A sense of peace filling your entire chest.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The warmth spreads through your stomach. Any knots or butterflies dissolving completely. Your stomach becoming soft and relaxed.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Into your lower back. Feel it softening. The muscles along your spine releasing their grip. Your entire back sinking into whatever supports you.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Through your hips now, releasing any tightness. Down into your thighs. Your large leg muscles becoming completely limp, loose, and heavy.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Past your knees, into your calves. These muscles that carry you through each day—resting now. Completely at peace.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Into your ankles, your feet, your toes. Every muscle, every joint, every cell of your body now bathed in deep relaxation.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

You are deeply relaxed, Austin. Your body is at peace. Your mind is calm and receptive. The better you feel, the deeper you go. The deeper you go, the more open you are to developing patience.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== DEEPENING - 20-Step Staircase (8-10 minutes) ===

In your mind's eye, you find yourself at the top of a beautiful staircase. This staircase has twenty steps, and it leads down to a peaceful garden—a place where time moves slowly and patience is natural.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The banister is smooth beneath your hand. The steps are solid and safe. With each step you descend, you will go twice as deep into hypnosis and closer to understanding the roots of impatience.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Step twenty. Taking the first step down. Feeling relaxation deepen. Beginning to understand.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step nineteen. Going deeper. The rushing of life fading.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step eighteen. Deeper still. Time slowing down.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step seventeen. Every step takes you deeper. Every step brings more calm.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step sixteen. Mind quieting. Urgency dissolving.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step fifteen. Halfway there. So relaxed. No hurry.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step fourteen. Deeper than before. Peace developing.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step thirteen. Feeling profoundly at peace.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step twelve. Your subconscious ready to understand impatience.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step eight. Going deeper still.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step six. Almost there, Austin.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step five. So deep now. Completely ready.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step four. Deeper than you have ever been.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step three. The garden gate is just ahead.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step two. One more step.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step one. You step into a peaceful garden. Time moves slowly here. There is no rush. In this garden, you will understand impatience and begin to develop patience. Everything you hear will be absorbed completely by your subconscious mind.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== THERAPEUTIC CONTENT (15-18 minutes) ===

--- What Is Impatience? ---

In this peaceful garden, you can see impatience clearly for what it is. Impatience is a form of resistance—resistance to the present moment because it is not what you want.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Impatience says: "This should be happening faster. This should be different. I should not have to wait."

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When you are impatient, you are mentally arguing with reality. And that argument creates tension, frustration, and suffering—even when the thing you are waiting for is not that important.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Impatience is essentially a refusal to accept the present moment. It is living in the gap between how things are and how you think they should be.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

In this garden, there is no gap. Things simply are what they are. And you can rest in that reality.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- The Roots of Impatience ---

Where does impatience come from? Let us explore its roots.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

First, impatience is a HABIT. Your brain has been trained to expect speed. Instant downloads. Same-day delivery. Immediate responses to texts. When the world does not match these expectations, frustration arises.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

But habits can be retrained. New neural pathways can develop. Patience can become as automatic as impatience once was.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Second, impatience often comes from a sense of SCARCITY. If you believe time is scarce, waiting feels like loss. If you believe there is not enough—not enough time, not enough opportunities—then delays feel threatening.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

But what if time is not your enemy? What if there is enough time for what truly matters? What if waiting is not wasted time but sacred space?

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Third, impatience is fueled by the ILLUSION OF CONTROL. You believe that if you push harder, things will move faster. That your frustration will somehow speed things up. But it rarely does—it only makes you suffer while you wait.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The truth is that many things are beyond your control. The speed of traffic. The pace of other people. The time growth takes. Accepting this is the beginning of patience.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Fourth, impatience can be connected to IDENTITY. Perhaps you have told yourself, "I'm just an impatient person." This becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. You act impatiently because that is who you believe you are.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

But identity can change. You are not defined by your habits. You can become a patient person—not because you have always been one, but because you choose to develop patience now.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- The Costs of Impatience ---

Impatience is expensive. Let us count its costs.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Impatience damages RELATIONSHIPS. When you are impatient with your spouse, your children, your coworkers, they feel it. They feel rushed, unvalued, like a burden. Over time, this erodes trust and intimacy.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Think of times when someone was impatient with you. How did it feel? Did it make you want to be closer to them or further away?

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Impatience damages your HEALTH. When you are impatient, your nervous system is activated. Stress hormones flood your body. Heart rate increases. Blood pressure rises. If this happens frequently, it takes a toll.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Living impatiently is living in chronic low-level stress. It wears you out from the inside.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Impatience damages your DECISIONS. When you are impatient, you rush. You take shortcuts. You choose the quick option over the right option. You abandon things before they have time to work.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Many of life's best outcomes require time—building a career, growing a marriage, developing character. Impatience sabotages these long-term investments.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Impatience damages your PEACE. When you are impatient, you are never at rest. Every delay is an irritation. Every slow moment is suffered rather than savored. You cannot enjoy the journey because you are always fixated on arrival.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This is perhaps the greatest cost: a life spent fighting the present moment rather than living in it.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- The Promise of Patience ---

Now let us see the other side: what patience offers.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Patience brings PEACE. When you are patient, you accept the present moment as it is. Waiting becomes rest rather than struggle. Delays become space rather than waste.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Patience strengthens RELATIONSHIPS. When you are patient with others, they feel accepted, valued, loved. You create safety for them to be themselves. This deepens trust and intimacy.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Patience improves OUTCOMES. When you are patient, you make wiser decisions. You let things mature. You give your efforts time to work. You see things through to completion.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Patience reflects CHARACTER. In the scriptures, patience is listed as a fruit of the Spirit. It is a mark of spiritual maturity. When you develop patience, you become more like the Savior—who waits for us with infinite patience.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Installing Your Patience Anchor ---

We are going to create an anchor now. This anchor will help you access patience in moments when impatience arises.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Gently bring your hands together, interlacing your fingers. Let your hands rest comfortably, fingers woven together.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This is the posture of patience. It is the posture of waiting. It is the posture of prayer. Hands together, at rest, not grasping or pushing.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

As you hold this gesture, feel calm spreading through your entire body. The rushing stops. The urgency dissolves. There is nowhere else you need to be. This moment is enough.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Say internally: "I have time. I can wait. I am at peace with this moment."

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Whenever impatience arises, you will bring your hands together in this way. The anchor will activate calm, acceptance, and patience.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Release your hands now. The anchor is installed. We will strengthen it throughout this series.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- A New Understanding ---

Austin, you now understand impatience more clearly than before. It is a habit that can change. It is rooted in false beliefs about time and control. It is costly—in relationships, health, decisions, and peace.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

And patience is possible for you. Not through gritting your teeth, but through changing your relationship with time, with waiting, with the present moment.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

In the sessions ahead, you will learn specific practices. But today, simply hold this new understanding. Patience is worth developing. And you are capable of developing it.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== POST-HYPNOTIC SUGGESTIONS (2-3 minutes) ===

Let these truths sink deep into your subconscious mind now.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You will begin to notice when impatience arises. This awareness is the first step. You will catch yourself getting frustrated and recognize: "This is impatience."

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When impatience arises, you will use your anchor. Hands together, fingers interlaced. Calm will spread through you.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You will begin to question impatient thoughts. "Is this really urgent? Is my frustration helping? Can I accept this moment?"

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The costs of impatience will become more visible to you—how it affects your relationships, your health, your peace. This visibility will motivate change.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You are becoming a patient person. This identity is taking root.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== EMERGENCE (3-5 minutes) ===

It is time to return to full waking consciousness, bringing your new understanding with you.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

In a moment, I will count from one to ten. With each number, you will become more alert, more awake, while patience continues developing.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One. Beginning the journey back. New understanding planted.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Two. Feeling energy returning to your body. Calm energy.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Three. Understanding of impatience is clear.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Four. Your mind clearing. Your anchor installed.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Five. Halfway back now. Feeling peaceful. No rush.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Six. More alert with each breath. Still calm.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Seven. Almost there. Ready to practice patience.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Eight. Eyes preparing to open. At peace.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Nine. Nearly fully awake. Taking a deep, refreshing breath.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Ten. Eyes open, fully alert, completely refreshed, and beginning to develop patience.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Welcome back, Austin. You have taken the first step on a valuable journey.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

You now understand impatience—its roots, its costs, and why patience is worth developing. Your anchor is installed: hands together, fingers interlaced, patience activated.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

In the coming days, notice when impatience arises. Use your anchor. Remember: you have time. You can wait. You are at peace with this moment.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

In the sessions ahead, we will build on this foundation with specific practices. For now, simply be aware. Patience is developing in you.
