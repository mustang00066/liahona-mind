=== PRE-TALK / SETTLING (2-3 minutes) ===

Welcome back, Austin. In our first session, you learned to understand impatience—its roots and its costs. Today we develop your most powerful patience tool: the pause.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Between stimulus and response, there is a space. In that space is your power to choose. Most people react instantly to frustrating situations. They have no pause—just trigger, then reaction.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Today you will develop the ability to pause before reacting. This pause is where patience lives. It is the difference between being controlled by circumstances and responding wisely to them.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The pause is simple but transformative. It allows you to choose patience rather than letting impatience choose for you. Let us begin.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== INDUCTION - Eye Fatigue with Diaphragmatic Breathing (10-12 minutes) ===

Begin by finding a spot on the ceiling or wall, slightly above your natural line of sight. A spot that requires you to look upward without straining your neck.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Focus on that spot. Keep your eyes fixed there as you begin to breathe deeply. Diaphragmatic breathing—belly expanding as you breathe in, sinking as you breathe out.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Breathe in through your nose... belly rising gently... hold for a moment... this is a pause... and release through your mouth. Notice how the pause in your breathing creates space.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Continue gazing at that spot. Notice how your eyes begin to feel. A slight strain. A heaviness developing. This is natural and welcome.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Another breath now... deeper than before... belly expanding... hold—pause—and release. Each pause creates peace.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Keep your eyes on that spot. They are growing heavier. The muscles around your eyes are tiring. Some of you may notice a watering of the eyes. Others feel a pulling sensation.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Breathe in once more... letting the breath fill your entire chest cavity... hold... and as you exhale, notice your eyes wanting to close. When the desire becomes strong enough, allow them to close naturally.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

If your eyes have not yet closed, take another breath and let them close with the exhale. There is no rush.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Eyes now closed... feel the relief. Notice how the pause between breaths creates a sense of calm. This is the same pause you will use when frustration arises.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Now that your eyes are closed, bring your attention to your breathing. Allow each breath to deepen the relaxation flowing through your body.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

With your next breath, focus on your scalp. Feel it softening, relaxing. Any tension held there simply melting away.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

This warmth flows down to your forehead. Feel the muscles of your forehead smoothing out. All worry lines dissolving.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Down to your eyes now—those tired muscles resting deeply. Your eyelids becoming wonderfully heavy.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The relaxation spreads to your cheeks and jaw. Your jaw becoming slack. Your teeth parting slightly.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Down into your neck. Feel each vertebra of your neck relaxing.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The wave of relaxation flows into your shoulders. Feel yours dropping now. Releasing their load. Becoming soft and heavy.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Down through your arms. The relaxation flowing like warm honey through your upper arms... your elbows... your forearms. Into your wrists and hands.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Your chest now. Feel your breathing becoming even slower, even deeper. Your heart beating calmly, steadily.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The warmth spreads through your stomach. Any knots or butterflies dissolving completely.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Into your lower back. Feel it softening. The muscles along your spine releasing their grip.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Through your hips now, releasing any tightness. Down into your thighs. Your large leg muscles becoming completely limp, loose, and heavy.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Past your knees, into your calves. Resting now. Completely at peace.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Into your ankles, your feet, your toes. Every muscle, every joint, every cell bathed in deep relaxation.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

You are deeply relaxed, Austin. Your body is at peace. Your mind is calm and receptive. Ready to learn the pause practice.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== DEEPENING - 20-Step Staircase (8-10 minutes) ===

In your mind's eye, you find yourself at the top of a beautiful staircase. This staircase has twenty steps, and it leads down to a space between moments—the sacred pause where patience is born.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The banister is smooth beneath your hand. The steps are solid and safe. With each step you descend, you will go deeper into hypnosis and the pause will become more natural.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Step twenty. Taking the first step down. Pausing between steps.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step nineteen. Going deeper. The pause expanding.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step eighteen. Deeper still. Space developing between stimulus and response.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step three. The sacred space is just ahead.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step two. One more step.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step one. You enter the space between stimulus and response. Here, time stretches. Here, you have room to choose. Here, patience becomes possible. Everything you hear will be absorbed completely.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== THERAPEUTIC CONTENT (15-18 minutes) ===

--- The Space Between ---

In this sacred space, you can see clearly: between every stimulus and response, there is a gap. It may be a split second, but it is there.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When someone says something frustrating—there is a gap before you respond.
When traffic slows down—there is a gap before you react.
When your child misbehaves—there is a gap before you speak.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Most people live as if there is no gap. Trigger, reaction. Trigger, reaction. They are on autopilot, controlled by circumstances.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

But you are learning to find the gap. To widen it. To live in it. This is where patience is born.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- The Three-Breath Pause ---

Let me teach you a practice you can use anytime frustration arises. It is called the three-breath pause.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When you notice frustration building—stop. Before reacting, take three deliberate breaths.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

BREATH ONE: Breathe in slowly... and exhale. With this breath, you are recognizing that you are about to react. You are pressing pause on the autopilot.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

BREATH TWO: Breathe in slowly... and exhale. With this breath, you are creating space. You are expanding the gap. Time is stretching.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

BREATH THREE: Breathe in slowly... and exhale. With this breath, you are choosing. You are deciding how to respond rather than reacting automatically.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Three breaths. Perhaps five seconds. But in those five seconds, everything changes. You move from reaction to response. From victim to author.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Programming the Pause ---

Let us install this practice deeply in your subconscious.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Imagine a situation that typically triggers your impatience. Perhaps waiting in line. Perhaps someone driving slowly. Perhaps your computer loading. See it in your mind.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Notice the familiar feelings beginning to arise—the tension, the frustration, the urge to react.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Now—pause. Press stop on the old program.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Take the first breath. Slow and deep. You are pressing pause.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Take the second breath. Creating space. The gap is widening.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Take the third breath. Choosing. How do you want to respond?

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Notice how different this feels. The same trigger, but a completely different experience. The frustration is still there, but you are not controlled by it.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- The Anchor Enhanced ---

Bring your hands together now, fingers interlaced, reinforcing your patience anchor.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This anchor is now linked to the three-breath pause. When you use this anchor, you automatically create space. The pause becomes natural.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Feel the calm spreading through you. Say internally: "I pause before I react. I choose my response. I am patient."

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

This anchor is growing stronger.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Release your hands.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Widening the Gap ---

The more you practice the pause, the wider the gap becomes. At first, you may only catch yourself after reacting. That is okay—you are building awareness.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Then you will catch yourself during the reaction. You will pause mid-stream and shift.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Eventually, you will pause before reacting. The gap will be automatic. You will see the trigger, feel the space, and choose calmly.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This is the journey you are on. Each time you pause, you are rewiring your brain. Creating new neural pathways. Making patience easier.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Patience is a Muscle ---

Think of patience like a muscle. Every time you practice the pause, you are doing a rep. The muscle gets stronger.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

At first, the muscle is weak. Pausing feels difficult, unnatural. Your old habit of reacting is strong.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

But with practice, the patience muscle grows. Pausing becomes easier. Eventually, it becomes your default.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You are building this muscle now. Every pause is progress.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- The Scriptures and the Pause ---

The Savior demonstrated perfect patience. He was mocked, rejected, and crucified—yet He did not react with anger or impatience.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

"When he was reviled, he reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not." This is the pause perfected.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

He had every reason to react. He had the power to react. But He chose patience. He chose love. He chose redemption.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

As you develop the pause, you are becoming more like Him. You are learning to respond from love rather than react from frustration.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Compassion in the Pause ---

One more gift the pause offers: compassion. When you pause before reacting to someone, you have time to wonder about their story.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The slow driver—maybe they are afraid, or elderly, or lost.
The rude clerk—maybe they are having a terrible day.
The misbehaving child—maybe they are tired, or hungry, or struggling.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The pause creates space for understanding. And understanding generates patience naturally.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== POST-HYPNOTIC SUGGESTIONS (2-3 minutes) ===

Let this practice sink deep into your subconscious mind now.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Whenever frustration begins to arise, you will notice it early. This awareness is automatic.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When you notice frustration, you will pause. Three breaths will become natural. The gap will widen.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

In the pause, you will choose your response. You will not be controlled by triggers. You are the author of your reactions.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your anchor—hands interlaced—reinforces the pause. Calm spreads when you use it.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Each day, your patience muscle grows stronger. Pausing becomes easier and more natural.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== EMERGENCE (3-5 minutes) ===

It is time to return to full waking consciousness, bringing the pause practice with you.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

In a moment, I will count from one to ten. With each number, you will become more alert, more awake, while the pause becomes more natural.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One. Beginning the journey back. The pause installed.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Two. Feeling energy returning to your body. Calm.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Three. The three-breath pause is programmed.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Four. Your mind clearing. Your anchor strengthened.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Five. Halfway back now. Feeling peaceful.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Six. More alert with each breath. Still calm.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Seven. Almost there. Ready to practice pausing.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Eight. Eyes preparing to open. At peace.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Nine. Nearly fully awake. Taking a deep, refreshing breath.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Ten. Eyes open, fully alert, completely refreshed, and equipped with the pause practice.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Welcome back, Austin. You now have a powerful tool.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

The three-breath pause: recognition, space, choice. Use it whenever frustration arises. Each time you pause, you are building patience.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

In the coming days, practice catching yourself. Press pause before reacting. The gap will widen. Patience will grow.
