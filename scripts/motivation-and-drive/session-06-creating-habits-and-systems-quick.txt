=== PRE-TALK / SETTLING (1-2 minutes) ===

Welcome back, Austin. Today we focus on habits and systems—what makes motivation automatic.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Willpower is limited. But habits do not require willpower. Once automatic, good behaviors happen without conscious effort.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let us create systems for automatic success.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== INDUCTION - Rapid Relaxation with Breathing (5-6 minutes) ===

Take a deep breath now. Diaphragmatic breathing—belly expanding as you breathe in, sinking as you breathe out.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Breathe in through your nose... belly rising gently... hold for a moment... and release. You can design your life for automatic success.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Another breath... deeper... and as you exhale, allow your eyes to close naturally.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let your neck become loose like rubber bands. Head floating. Jaws sagging. Shoulders dropping.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Arms becoming limp, loose, and heavy. All the way down to your hands.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Legs and feet the same. The better you feel, the deeper you go. Systems forming.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Your eyelids becoming wonderfully heavy. As though gently stuck together. Ready to design.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== DEEPENING (3-4 minutes) ===

Imagine yourself at the top of a staircase... ten steps leading down to a place of design.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Ten. Stepping down. Systems awareness growing.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Nine. Deeper. Habits forming.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Eight. Ready for automation.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Seven. Deeper still.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Six. Halfway there.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Five. So designed. So structured.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Four. Almost there.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Three. Deep systems thinking.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Two. One more step.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

One. You enter a place of design. Here you can create habits and systems that carry you forward automatically. Everything you learn will run on autopilot.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== THERAPEUTIC CONTENT (8-10 minutes) ===

Receive only what serves you. Your subconscious mind will accept what is true for you and let the rest go.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

--- The Habit Loop ---

Habits follow a pattern: cue, routine, reward. A clear cue, an easy routine, a satisfying reward.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Making Habits Work ---

Make habits OBVIOUS: Use implementation intentions—"When [situation], I will [behavior]." Stack habits on existing ones.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Make habits ATTRACTIVE: Pair what you need to do with what you want to do. Reframe "have to" as "get to."

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Make habits EASY: Start with two minutes. Reduce friction. Prepare what you need in advance.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Make habits SATISFYING: Track progress. Celebrate completion. Never miss twice.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Systems Over Goals ---

Goals are what you want. Systems are how you get there. You fall to the level of your systems.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Design a system—a process repeated consistently—and results follow naturally.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Your Key Habits ---

What one habit would improve each area? Physical. Professional. Relational. Spiritual.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

For each, identify a clear cue and a two-minute starting version.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Anchor Reinforcement ---

Make a fist, reinforcing your drive anchor.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

This anchor carries systems thinking. Say internally: "I design systems for success. Good behavior is automatic."

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Release your fist.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== POST-HYPNOTIC SUGGESTIONS (1 minute) ===

You will design habits using cue-routine-reward.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

You will make habits obvious, attractive, easy, and satisfying.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

You will focus on systems. Never miss twice.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== EMERGENCE (2-3 minutes) ===

It is time to return to full awareness, bringing systems wisdom with you.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

I will count from one to five. With each number, you become more alert while habits form.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

One. Beginning to return. Systems installed.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Two. Energy returning. Habits forming.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Three. Automation developing.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Four. Almost fully alert. Designed.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Five. Eyes open, fully awake, completely alert, and systems in place.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Welcome back, Austin. Choose one habit. Make the cue obvious. Start with two minutes. Track progress. Let automation carry you forward.
