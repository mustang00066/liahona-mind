=== PRE-TALK / SETTLING (1-2 minutes) ===

Welcome to your final session, Austin. You have learned how motivation works, connected to purpose, built momentum, overcome procrastination, sustained energy, created systems, and developed resilience.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Today we bring everything together—becoming a person who lives with purpose and drive as a core part of who you are.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let us seal everything you have learned.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== INDUCTION - Rapid Relaxation with Breathing (5-6 minutes) ===

Take a deep breath now. Diaphragmatic breathing—belly expanding as you breathe in, sinking as you breathe out.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Breathe in through your nose... belly rising gently... hold for a moment... and release. You are becoming who you are meant to be.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Another breath... deeper... and as you exhale, allow your eyes to close naturally.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let your neck become loose like rubber bands. Head floating. Jaws sagging. Shoulders dropping.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Arms becoming limp, loose, and heavy. All the way down to your hands.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Legs and feet the same. The better you feel, the deeper you go. Integration occurring.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Your eyelids becoming wonderfully heavy. As though gently stuck together. Ready to transform.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== THERAPEUTIC CONTENT (8-10 minutes) ===

Release your fist.
