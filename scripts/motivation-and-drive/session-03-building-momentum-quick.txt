=== PRE-TALK / SETTLING (1-2 minutes) ===

Welcome back, Austin. Today we focus on building momentum—the force that makes motivation feel effortless.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

An object in motion tends to stay in motion. Once you get moving, continuing becomes easier. The challenge is getting started.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let us learn to build unstoppable momentum.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== INDUCTION - Rapid Relaxation with Breathing (5-6 minutes) ===

Take a deep breath now. Diaphragmatic breathing—belly expanding as you breathe in, sinking as you breathe out.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Breathe in through your nose... belly rising gently... hold for a moment... and release. Starting creates motivation.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Another breath... deeper... and as you exhale, allow your eyes to close naturally.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let your neck become loose like rubber bands. Head floating. Jaws sagging. Shoulders dropping.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Arms becoming limp, loose, and heavy. All the way down to your hands.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Legs and feet the same. The better you feel, the deeper you go. Momentum building.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Your eyelids becoming wonderfully heavy. As though gently stuck together. Ready for action.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== DEEPENING (3-4 minutes) ===

Imagine yourself at the top of a staircase... ten steps leading down to a place of momentum.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Ten. Stepping down. Already moving.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Nine. Deeper. Motion beginning.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Eight. Ready for action.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Seven. Deeper still.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Six. Halfway there.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Five. So energized. So ready.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Four. Almost there.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Three. Deep momentum.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Two. One more step.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

One. You enter a place of momentum. Here you can develop the ability to start and continue with ease. Everything you learn will propel you forward.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== THERAPEUTIC CONTENT (8-10 minutes) ===

Receive only what serves you. Your subconscious mind will accept what is true for you and let the rest go.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

--- Understanding Inertia ---

An object at rest tends to stay at rest. This is physics, not a character flaw.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The key insight: starting is the hardest part. Once you begin, continuing becomes easier.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- The Two-Minute Rule ---

Commit to doing something for just two minutes. Anyone can do anything for two minutes.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You do not have to write a chapter—just write for two minutes. You do not have to exercise for an hour—just exercise for two minutes.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

After two minutes, you usually continue. The commitment was just the spark.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- The Smallest Step ---

Identify the smallest possible step and take it. Something so easy you cannot say no.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Put on workout clothes. Open the document. Find the phone number. The smallest step leads to the next step.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- The Power of Small Wins ---

Each small win provides dopamine. Your brain registers success and wants more.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Break large tasks into smaller pieces. Complete one, then another. Momentum compounds.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Protecting Momentum ---

When you are in flow, protect it. Do not interrupt unnecessarily. Ride the momentum.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Consistency beats intensity. A little bit every day creates more momentum than a lot once in a while.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Anchor Reinforcement ---

Make a fist, reinforcing your drive anchor.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

This anchor carries momentum. Say internally: "I start. I move. Motion creates more motion."

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Release your fist.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== POST-HYPNOTIC SUGGESTIONS (1 minute) ===

You will start. You will not wait for motivation—you will create it through action.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

You will use the two-minute rule and smallest step to break inertia.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

When momentum stalls, you will restart quickly.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== EMERGENCE (2-3 minutes) ===

It is time to return to full awareness, bringing momentum with you.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

I will count from one to five. With each number, you become more alert while momentum builds.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

One. Beginning to return. Momentum building.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Two. Energy returning. Ready to start.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Three. Inertia breaking.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Four. Almost fully alert. In motion.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Five. Eyes open, fully awake, completely alert, and ready to build momentum.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Welcome back, Austin. Today, take the smallest step on something you have been avoiding. Two minutes. One action. Break inertia.
