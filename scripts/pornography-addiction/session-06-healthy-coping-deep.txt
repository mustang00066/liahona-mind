=== PRE-TALK / SETTLING (2-3 minutes) ===

Welcome back, Austin. Find a comfortable position now and allow yourself to settle into stillness. You have been doing powerful work, and today we add something essential: healthy coping mechanisms.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Here is a truth you must understand: pornography and masturbation have been serving a function in your life. They have been coping tools—ways you have managed difficult emotions like stress, loneliness, boredom, anxiety, and sadness.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The problem is not that you have been coping. The problem is that you have been using terrible coping tools—tools that provide momentary escape but no resolution, tools that leave you worse off than before.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Today we replace these with healthy coping mechanisms—tools that actually work, that process emotions rather than avoid them, that leave you better than before without shame or aftermath.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let us build your new toolkit.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== INDUCTION - Eye Fatigue and Diaphragmatic Breathing (10-12 minutes) ===

Before we close your eyes, find a spot above your natural line of sight. Perhaps on the ceiling... or high on the wall ahead of you. Focus your eyes on that spot now.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Notice how this upward gaze begins to tire your eye muscles. This eye fatigue prepares you for installing new coping patterns. As your eyes grow heavier, your mind opens to healthier ways of managing life.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

As you hold this gaze, begin your diaphragmatic breathing. Belly breathing... when you breathe in, your belly expands like a balloon filling with air. When you breathe out, your belly button sinks toward your spine.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Breathe in deeply through your nose... let your belly rise... hold for a moment... and release slowly through your mouth. With each exhale, new coping pathways strengthen.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

This breathing itself is a coping tool. Deep, slow breathing activates your parasympathetic nervous system, calming your body and mind. You are using it right now.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Take another deep belly breath. Your eyes still focused upward... heavier now... more tired. Breathe in... belly expanding... hold... and release. Healthy patterns are being installed.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

Your eyelids are growing so heavy. Like weights are attached to them. Allow this heaviness to deepen with each breath.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

One more breath. And as you exhale this time, allow your eyes to close. Let them fall shut with relief. Your eyes are closed now, and you are ready to build your toolkit.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Good. Now imagine your neck becoming like a bundle of loose rubber bands. All tension dissolving. Your head floating gently... weightless... like a helium balloon.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Allow your jaws to sag. Your mouth opening slightly. Your tongue resting loosely on the floor of your mouth. The forehead smoothing out completely.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let your shoulders sag completely. All the weight you carry there... dropping away. Shoulders sinking... sinking... as low as they can possibly go.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

Your arms becoming limp, loose, and heavy. So limp, so loose, so heavy. From shoulders to fingertips, complete relaxation.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

Your hands, Austin. Feel them completely at rest.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Now your legs and feet. Allow them to become limp, loose, and heavy. So limp, so loose, so heavy.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

The better you feel, the deeper you go. The deeper you go, the more powerful your new coping tools become.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

It feels so good to just relax. It feels so good to just breathe. It feels so good to know that you are gaining healthy tools.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Your eyelids now... so relaxed they've become wonderfully heavy. As though stuck together with gentle glue. They are at peace.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

From head to toe, you are deeply relaxed. Your body is at peace. Your mind is ready to install new patterns. Let us go deeper.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== DEEPENING (8-10 minutes) ===

Now, imagine yourself at the top of a staircase. This staircase leads down to a workshop where healthy coping tools are crafted and installed in your life.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

There are twenty steps. With each step, you go deeper and your new toolkit becomes more complete. By the bottom, you will have everything you need to cope in healthy ways.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step twenty. You place your foot on the first step. Beginning to descend. New tools already forming.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Nineteen. Another step down. Deeper relaxation. Your capacity for healthy coping increasing.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Eighteen. Deeper now. Every part of you welcoming new patterns.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Seventeen. Going deeper. The workshop coming into view.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Sixteen. Old patterns being replaced with new.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Fifteen. Past the surface. Into deep pattern installation.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Fourteen. Deeper and deeper. Healthy tools solidifying.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Thirteen. So relaxed. So ready. So capable.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Twelve. The better you feel, the more powerful your tools.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Eleven. Halfway there. Halfway to complete installation.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Ten. Deeper. More equipped. More prepared.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Nine. Each step adding another tool to your toolkit.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Eight. Deeper. Healthy coping becoming automatic.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Seven. Almost there. The workshop clearly visible now.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Six. Profound depth. Profound capability.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Five. So deep now. Tools becoming permanent.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Four. The workshop doors opening.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Three. The final steps.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Two. One more step.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

One. You step into the coping toolkit workshop—a place where healthy patterns are installed and old patterns are replaced.

[PAUSE 8 SECONDS]

You are now in a state of deep hypnosis where powerful new coping mechanisms are being installed. Your conscious mind can relax while your subconscious absorbs these life-changing tools.

[PAUSE 8 SECONDS]

=== THERAPEUTIC CONTENT (15-18 minutes) ===

You remain in complete control. Your deeper mind will accept only the suggestions that align with your values and serve your growth. Everything else simply fades away.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

--- Understanding Why Addiction Became a Coping Tool ---

Austin, let us begin by understanding why pornography and masturbation became your go-to coping mechanisms.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

At some point in your life, you experienced difficult emotions—stress, loneliness, boredom, anxiety, sadness—and you discovered that pornography and masturbation provided temporary relief. The intense dopamine surge numbed the pain, at least for a moment.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Your brain learned: when feeling overwhelmed, use this escape. The pattern strengthened with each use. Eventually, it became automatic—difficult feelings triggered the behavior without conscious choice.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

This is not a moral failure. This is how brains work. They seek to reduce pain and increase pleasure. The problem is not that your brain learned to cope—the problem is that it learned a coping mechanism that does not actually work.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

--- Why These Are Terrible Coping Tools ---

Pornography and masturbation are terrible coping tools for several reasons.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

First, they provide escape but no resolution. The original problem—the stress, the loneliness, the anxiety—remains exactly as it was, or often worse. You have not solved anything; you have only delayed dealing with it.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Second, they create additional problems. Shame follows. Guilt follows. Sometimes relationship damage follows. The aftermath leaves you worse off than before.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Third, they strengthen the addiction pathway. Each use makes the next use more likely. You are not just coping—you are digging yourself deeper into the problem.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

True coping addresses the underlying issue. It processes the emotion rather than avoiding it. It leaves you genuinely better, not temporarily numb. Today we install tools that actually work.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

--- Emotional Coping ---

The first category of healthy coping is emotional coping—learning to process emotions rather than escape them.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Emotions are messengers. They carry information about your needs, your values, your situation. When you escape emotions through addiction, you miss the message. The emotion keeps returning because it has not delivered its message.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The alternative is to feel your feelings. When sadness comes, let yourself be sad. When anger comes, let yourself feel it. Do not judge the emotion—just experience it.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Name the emotion. Say to yourself, "I feel sad right now" or "I feel anxious." This simple act creates distance between you and the emotion. You are not the emotion—you are someone experiencing an emotion.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Prayer is powerful emotional coping. Pouring out your heart to Heavenly Father processes the emotion while connecting you to divine help. The Psalmist did this constantly: "I cried unto the Lord with my voice... I poured out my complaint before him."

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Journaling is another emotional coping tool. Writing externalizes the feelings, creating clarity and distance. The emotion loses some of its overwhelming power when it is on paper instead of just swirling in your mind.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

--- Physical Coping ---

The second category is physical coping—using your body to manage your mind.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Your body and mind are connected. Physical states affect emotional states. When you move your body, you change your brain chemistry.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Exercise is one of the most powerful coping tools available. It releases endorphins—natural mood elevators. It burns off stress hormones. It promotes the growth of new brain cells. Even a brief walk shifts your emotional state.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

When urges strike or emotions overwhelm, move your body. Go for a run. Do push-ups. Take a brisk walk. Physical action breaks mental spirals. The energy that was fueling the urge gets redirected into healthy movement.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Cold water is remarkably effective. A cold shower or even splashing cold water on your face triggers a shock response that resets your nervous system. It is hard to stay in a craving state when your body is responding to cold.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Sleep is also physical coping. Remember T in HALT: tired. When you are exhausted, your willpower is depleted and healthy coping is harder. Prioritizing rest is not laziness—it is essential self-care.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Nutrition matters too. What you eat affects how you feel. Blood sugar crashes can trigger emotional volatility. Eating regular, balanced meals supports emotional stability.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

--- Social Coping ---

The third category is social coping—using connection to manage difficult emotions.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

We are created for connection. Isolation breeds addiction—it is both a cause and a symptom. One of the most powerful things you can do when struggling is reach out to another person.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Call a friend. Visit family. Text your accountability partner. Even if you do not discuss what you are struggling with, the presence of another person changes your internal state.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Sometimes just being with others is enough. You do not always need to process feelings verbally. Sometimes you need to watch a game together, share a meal, work on a project side by side. Their presence reminds you that you are not alone.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Service to others is powerful social coping. When you focus on someone else's needs, your own problems temporarily shrink. Helping others releases oxytocin and creates genuine connection.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The key is to move toward people, not away from them. When the urge to isolate arises, recognize it as a warning sign and do the opposite.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

--- Spiritual Coping ---

The fourth category is spiritual coping—connecting with God and spiritual resources.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Scripture study brings perspective and peace. The word of God has power to calm troubled minds. When emotions overwhelm, immersing yourself in scripture changes your internal landscape.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Prayer—both speaking and listening—connects you to divine help. You are not meant to carry this alone. The Lord has invited you to cast your burden upon Him, and He will sustain you.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Temple attendance, if available, brings profound healing. The peace of the temple, the focus on eternal things, the covenants renewed—all of these recalibrate your soul.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Worship and praise shift focus from your problems to God's greatness. Gratitude practice reminds you of blessings even in the midst of struggle.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

--- Cognitive Coping ---

The fifth category is cognitive coping—changing how you think about situations.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Your thoughts about a situation affect your emotions about that situation. When you change your thoughts, you change your emotional response.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Learn to question negative thoughts. When a distressing thought arises, ask: Is this thought true? Is there evidence for it? Is this thought helpful? What would a wiser, more balanced perspective be?

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Reframe challenges as opportunities for growth. The very situations that trigger your addiction can become the training ground for your freedom. Each difficult moment you navigate without acting out strengthens your capacity.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Remember eternal perspective. The troubles of this moment are temporary. You are on a journey that extends beyond this life. What feels overwhelming now will one day be a distant memory, a testimony of how God brought you through.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

--- Creating Your Coping Menu ---

Now, let us create your personal coping menu—a list of healthy options available when difficult emotions arise.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

In your mind, see a menu with five sections: Emotional, Physical, Social, Spiritual, Cognitive. Under each section are specific actions you can take.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Emotional: Feel the feeling. Name it. Pray. Journal. Cry if you need to.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Physical: Exercise. Walk. Run. Cold water. Push-ups. Deep breathing.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Social: Call a friend. Visit family. Text accountability partner. Serve someone.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Spiritual: Read scripture. Pray. Attend temple. Worship. Practice gratitude.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Cognitive: Question the thought. Reframe. Remember eternal perspective.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

This menu is now installed in your mind. When difficult emotions arise, the menu appears. You can choose any healthy option instead of the old destructive pattern.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

--- Installing the New Pattern ---

Imagine yourself facing a stressful day. Emotions build. The old pathway—the urge toward pornography and masturbation—begins to activate.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

But now, something new happens. Before the old pattern can complete, the coping menu appears. You see all your options laid out before you.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

You choose one. Perhaps you go for a walk. Perhaps you call a friend. Perhaps you pray. Whatever you choose, you act on it.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The emotional pressure releases in a healthy way. You feel actually better—not temporarily numb, but genuinely improved. No shame follows. No aftermath. Just resolution.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

This is your new pattern. Difficult feelings lead to healthy coping. Healthy coping leads to actual resolution. This is what you were seeking all along—real relief, not counterfeit escape.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

--- Anchor Reinforcement ---

Now, press your thumb and second finger together.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

This anchor now carries your full coping toolkit. All five categories. All the specific tools. The coping menu. The new pattern.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Whenever difficult emotions arise, use this anchor. Press thumb and second finger together and the menu appears. You have options. You have tools. You can cope in healthy ways.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Hold the pressure. Feel your toolkit solidifying.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Release. The tools are installed.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Scripture Foundation ---

The Savior said: "In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world."

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Tribulation is certain. You will face stress, sadness, loneliness, and difficulty. This is part of mortal life. But tribulation does not require escape—it requires coping.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

And you are not alone in coping. He has overcome. His grace is available. His strength can flow through you as you use healthy tools. You are not white-knuckling through life—you are drawing on divine power while using wisdom.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

--- Future Pacing ---

See yourself tomorrow. A difficult emotion arises. The coping menu appears. You choose a healthy option. You feel better—genuinely, not temporarily.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

A week from now. You have used healthy coping multiple times. Each use strengthens the new pathways. The old pattern is weakening.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

A month from now. Healthy coping is becoming automatic. When stress hits, your first instinct is a healthy tool, not the old escape. This is your new normal.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Six months from now. The old coping mechanism seems like a distant memory. You have a full toolkit and you use it skillfully. Life still has challenges, but you handle them in ways that leave you stronger.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

A year from now. You are a person who copes with life in healthy ways. Not perfectly—no one does—but consistently. You have real tools for real problems. The counterfeit has been replaced with the genuine.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

--- Direct Suggestions ---

And now, as you rest in this deep state, your subconscious mind receives direct suggestions for healthy coping installation.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You have a complete toolkit for handling difficult emotions. Emotional, physical, social, spiritual, and cognitive tools are all available to you.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

When difficult feelings arise, the coping menu appears automatically. You see your options and choose one. This happens naturally, without effort.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Healthy coping is replacing the old pattern. Each use of the new tools weakens the old pathway and strengthens the new.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

You are not removing coping from your life—you are upgrading it. Trading counterfeit comfort for real healing.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

You cope in ways that leave you better, not worse. No shame. No aftermath. Just genuine resolution.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

=== POST-HYPNOTIC SUGGESTIONS (2-3 minutes) ===

As you rest in this state of deep peace, your healthy coping toolkit is cementing permanently.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

In the days and weeks ahead, you will naturally reach for healthy tools when difficult emotions arise. The menu will appear, and you will choose wisely.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You will notice that healthy coping actually works. The emotions are processed, not just escaped. You feel genuinely better.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The old pattern is losing power. The new pattern is strengthening. You are becoming someone who handles life's difficulties with wisdom and grace.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Remember: you are not meant to cope alone. Divine help is available. Healthy tools are available. You have everything you need.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== EMERGENCE (3-5 minutes) ===
