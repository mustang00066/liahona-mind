Duration: ~28 minutes
Voice: Male, British accent, calm and compassionate

[BEGIN SCRIPT]

Welcome back, Austin. Today you master urges. Urges are temporary, manageable, and powerless unless you give them power.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Take a deep breath in... and release.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Another breath, centering yourself... and release.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One more breath... eyes closing, entering peace.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Relax completely. Head to toe. Complete peace.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Descend now. Ten to one. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Deep hypnosis.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Austin, an urge is just a feeling. A wave that passes. It is not a command. Every urge fades within minutes if you wait.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Urge surfing means watching the wave. Instead of fighting or giving in, you observe. Watch it rise, peak, and fall.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Practice now. Imagine a mild urge. Notice where you feel it. Observe without reacting. Say, I am watching this urge. I am not acting on it.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Breathe slowly. The urge changes. Intensifies briefly, then fades. You did nothing but watch, and it passes.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The Savior was tempted forty days. He let temptations come and go. You can do the same.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Use the delay technique. Wait ten minutes. Do something else. Change your environment. The urge weakens.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Use STOP: Stop. Take a breath. Observe. Proceed mindfully. This creates choice. Choice is freedom.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Physical movement breaks urges. Stand. Walk. Splash cold water. Movement tells your brain something changed.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Use your strength anchor. Thumb and finger pressed together. Feel power flow through you.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Visualize facing an urge. You observe. You delay. You STOP. You move. You use your anchor. The urge passes. Victory.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Each victory strengthens you. Urges weaken over time. You are building mastery.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One... beginning to return.
Two... feeling capable.
Three... becoming alert.
Four... refreshed.
Five... eyes open, fully alert. You have the tools, Austin. Use them.
