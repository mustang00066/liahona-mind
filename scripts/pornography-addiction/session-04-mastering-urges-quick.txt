=== PRE-TALK / SETTLING (1-2 minutes) ===

Welcome back, Austin. You have been building important skills. Today you add something essential: the ability to master urges.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Urges will come—this is simply how addiction works. The addiction pathways in your brain will fire from time to time. What matters is how you respond.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Today you will learn that urges are temporary, manageable, and powerless unless you give them power. Each urge you master weakens the addiction and strengthens your freedom.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== INDUCTION - Rapid Relaxation with Breathing (5-6 minutes) ===

Take a deep breath now. Diaphragmatic breathing—belly expanding as you breathe in, sinking as you breathe out.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Breathe in through your nose... belly rising... hold gently... and release through your mouth. With this exhale, your capacity for mastery increases.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Another breath... deeper... and as you exhale, allow your eyes to close naturally.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let your neck become loose like rubber bands. Head floating like a helium balloon. Jaws sagging. Shoulders dropping.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Arms becoming limp, loose, and heavy. All the way down to your hands.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Legs and feet the same. The better you feel, the deeper you go. The deeper you go, the more powerful your mastery.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Your eyelids becoming wonderfully heavy. As though gently stuck together. You are ready to learn urge mastery.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== DEEPENING (3-4 minutes) ===

Imagine yourself at the top of a staircase... ten steps leading down to a training ground for urge mastery.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Ten. Stepping down. Mastery skills forming.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Nine. Deeper. Your capacity for handling urges increasing.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Eight. Tools installing.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Seven. Deeper still.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Six. Halfway there.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Five. So deep. So capable.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Four. Almost there.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Three. Deep mastery.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Two. One more step.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

One. You arrive at the training ground where you gain power over every urge.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== THERAPEUTIC CONTENT (8-10 minutes) ===

Receive only what serves you. Your subconscious mind will accept what is true for you and let the rest go.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

--- The Nature of Urges ---

Austin, the most important truth about urges: they are temporary. They always pass. Always.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

An urge is a feeling—a sensation in your body and a thought in your mind. It is not a command. It is a wave that rises, peaks, and falls.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Most urges peak within fifteen to twenty minutes, then decline. If you wait it out, it will fade. This is biological certainty.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

In the moment, an urge may feel overwhelming. This is a lie the addiction tells. You can survive. On the other side is freedom.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Urge Surfing ---

Urge surfing teaches you to ride the wave rather than being swept away.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Instead of fighting or giving in, you observe. Watch the urge like a scientist—curious, detached, present.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Practice now. Imagine a mild urge. Notice where you feel it in your body. Observe without reacting.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Say: "I notice an urge arising. I am watching it. I am not acting on it."

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Breathe slowly. The urge may intensify briefly—that is the wave rising. Keep watching. Keep breathing.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Notice it beginning to fade. The wave is cresting and falling. You did nothing but observe, and it passes.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- The Delay Technique ---

When an urge strikes, commit to waiting before doing anything.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Tell yourself: "I will wait ten minutes." During those minutes, do something else. Change your environment. Call someone. Exercise.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You are not saying "no" forever—just "not yet." Almost always, by the end of ten minutes, the urge has weakened significantly or passed.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Delay works because urges rely on immediacy. Delay disrupts this pattern and gives your prefrontal cortex time to regain control.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- The STOP Technique ---

Use STOP anytime an urge arises.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

S - Stop what you are doing. Pause.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

T - Take a breath. One slow, deep breath.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

O - Observe the urge without judging it.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

P - Proceed mindfully. Choose your response deliberately.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

STOP creates a gap between stimulus and response. In that gap, you have choice. Choice is freedom.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Physical Movement ---

Physical movement breaks urges. When an urge strikes, move your body.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Stand up. Walk around. Do jumping jacks. Splash cold water on your face.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Cold water is particularly effective—it triggers a shock response that resets your nervous system.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Exercise releases natural dopamine, satisfying the craving in a healthy way.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Play the Tape Forward ---

When an urge arises, play the full tape forward.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Imagine acting on it. The temporary pleasure fades quickly. Then: the shame, the guilt, the empty feeling, the broken promises.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Now imagine not acting. The urge fades. You feel strong. You go to bed with peace instead of shame. Your freedom strengthens.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The urge shows only the first frame. Remember the whole film.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Anchor Reinforcement ---

Press your thumb and second finger together now.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

This anchor carries urge mastery. Urge surfing. Delay. STOP. Physical movement. Play the tape forward.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Whenever an urge arises, use this anchor and remember: I am a master of urges. This will pass. I have tools.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Release. The skills are installed.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

--- Scripture of Overcoming ---

The Apostle Paul wrote: God will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This is a promise. There is always a way of escape. These techniques are that way.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The Savior was tempted forty days. He let temptations come and go while holding to His truth. You can do the same.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== POST-HYPNOTIC SUGGESTIONS (1 minute) ===

Your subconscious now holds urge mastery. Urges are temporary waves. You are the surfer who rides them.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

When urges arise, you will respond with calm confidence. You know they will pass. You have tools.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Each victory strengthens you and weakens the addiction. You are building mastery.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== EMERGENCE (2-3 minutes) ===

It is time to return to full awareness with your urge-mastery skills active.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

I will count from one to five. With each number, you become more alert while your mastery becomes more solid.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

One. Beginning to return. Urge-mastery skills coming with you.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Two. More aware of your body. Urge surfing installed.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Three. Energy returning. STOP technique automatic.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Four. Almost fully alert. All tools available.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Five. Eyes open, fully awake, completely alert, and fully equipped.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Welcome back, Austin. You now have powerful tools for handling any urge. Urge surfing. Delay. STOP. Physical movement. Play the tape forward.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

When urges come, you know what to do. They are temporary waves. You are the surfer who remains standing. Master on.
