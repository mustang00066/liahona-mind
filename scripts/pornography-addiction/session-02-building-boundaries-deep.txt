Duration: ~38 minutes
Voice: Male, British accent, calm and compassionate

[BEGIN SCRIPT]

Welcome back, Austin. Today we build boundaries—the protective walls that keep you safe from temptation.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Take a deep breath in... and release.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Another breath, deeper... preparing to establish protection.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

One more breath... eyes closing, entering safety.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let relaxation flow through you. Head to toe. Complete peace.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Now, the staircase. Twenty steps down.

Twenty, nineteen, eighteen, seventeen, sixteen... going deeper.
Fifteen, fourteen, thirteen, twelve, eleven... boundaries forming.
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six... protection building.
Five, four, three, two, one... deep hypnosis achieved.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Austin, recovery requires boundaries. These are the limits you establish to protect yourself from situations where pornography and masturbation become likely.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Think of boundaries as three concentric circles. The outer green circle contains safe behaviors. The middle yellow circle contains warning signs. The inner red circle contains destructive behaviors you are avoiding.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

In the red circle: pornography use, masturbation to fantasy, any sexual content seeking. These are off-limits. Non-negotiable.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

In the yellow circle: being alone with devices late at night, browsing aimlessly, skipping accountability check-ins, isolating emotionally. These are warning signs to address immediately.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

In the green circle: healthy activities, connection with others, exercise, prayer, productive work, time with family. These are your safe zone.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Practical boundaries matter. Install filters on all devices. Share passwords with your accountability partner. No devices in bedrooms. No private internet use late at night.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When you feel urges to masturbate, recognize this as entering the yellow zone. The boundary response: leave the private space, reach out to someone, engage in physical activity.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The scripture teaches, Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation. Boundaries are how you watch. They keep you from situations where your defenses weaken.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

See yourself now living within your boundaries. Devices have filters. Accountability is active. You stay in the green circle. Safety surrounds you.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When you approach the yellow zone, an internal alarm sounds. You recognize the danger and redirect. The boundaries work automatically.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

These boundaries are not prison walls. They are protective walls around a garden. Inside them, you grow freely. Outside them lies danger.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Commit now to establishing and honoring your boundaries. They are the foundation of your freedom.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

As I count from one to ten, return to full awareness.

One... beginning to return.
Two... protected and prepared.
Three... becoming alert.
Four... refreshed.
Five... halfway back.
Six... alertness increasing.
Seven... feeling wonderful.
Eight... almost there.
Nine... nearly awake.
Ten... eyes open, fully alert. Build your boundaries today, Austin.
