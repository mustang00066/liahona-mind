=== PRE-TALK / SETTLING (2-3 minutes) ===

Welcome back, Austin. Find a comfortable position now and allow yourself to settle into stillness. You are continuing a journey toward freedom, and each step matters.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

In our first session, you learned about the nature of addiction—how it hijacks the brain's reward system, the addiction cycle, and the HALT framework. You understand now that this is a brain pattern, not a character flaw, and that your brain can be rewired.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Today we focus on something essential: boundaries. These are the protective structures you build around your life to make acting out difficult and recovery possible. Without boundaries, willpower alone is not enough. With boundaries, recovery becomes sustainable.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Think of boundaries as the walls of a fortress—not to imprison you, but to protect you. Inside the fortress you are free. The walls simply keep the enemy out.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let us build your fortress now.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== INDUCTION - Eye Fatigue and Diaphragmatic Breathing (10-12 minutes) ===

Before we close your eyes, find a spot above your natural line of sight. Perhaps on the ceiling... or high on the wall ahead of you. Focus your eyes on that spot now.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Notice how this upward gaze begins to tire your eye muscles. This eye fatigue is your pathway into deep relaxation. As your eyes grow heavier, your mind prepares to receive important new programming.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

As you hold this gaze, begin your diaphragmatic breathing. Belly breathing... when you breathe in, your belly expands like a balloon filling with air. When you breathe out, your belly button sinks toward your spine.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Breathe in deeply through your nose... let your belly rise... hold for a moment... and release slowly through your mouth. With each exhale, your boundaries grow stronger.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

This breathing stimulates your vagus nerve, activating your body's natural relaxation response. You are entering a state where deep learning becomes possible.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Take another deep belly breath. Your eyes still focused upward... heavier now... more tired. Breathe in... belly expanding... hold... and release. Protection is being installed.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

Your eyelids are growing so heavy. Like weights are attached to them. Allow this heaviness to deepen with each breath.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

One more breath. And as you exhale this time, allow your eyes to close. Let them fall shut with relief. Your eyes are closed now, and you are exactly where you need to be.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Good. Now imagine your neck becoming like a bundle of loose rubber bands. All tension dissolving. Your head floating gently... weightless... like a helium balloon.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Allow your jaws to sag. Your mouth opening slightly. Your tongue resting loosely on the floor of your mouth. The forehead smoothing out completely, as though ironed flat by an invisible hand.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let your shoulders sag completely. All the weight you carry there... dropping away. Shoulders sinking... sinking... sinking... as low as they can possibly go.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

Your arms becoming limp, loose, and heavy. So limp, so loose, so heavy. Like lead weights at your sides. From shoulders to fingertips, complete relaxation.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

Your hands, Austin. These hands that are learning new patterns. Feel them completely at rest. Relaxed and peaceful.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Now your legs and feet. Allow them to become limp, loose, and heavy. So limp, so loose, so heavy. Like they're sinking into the surface beneath you.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

The better you feel, the deeper you go. The deeper you go, the better you feel. And the stronger your boundaries become.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

It feels so good to just relax. It feels so good to just breathe. It feels so good to know that protection is being built.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Your eyelids now... so relaxed they've become wonderfully heavy. As though stuck together with gentle glue. If you were to try to open them, you would find they just don't want to work right now. They are at peace.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

From head to toe, you are deeply relaxed. Your body is at peace. Your mind is open to learning. You are ready to build your boundaries.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== DEEPENING (8-10 minutes) ===

Now, imagine yourself at the top of a staircase. This staircase leads down to a place where boundaries are built—a sacred workshop where the protective structures of your life are created and strengthened.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

There are twenty steps. With each step, you go deeper and your boundaries grow stronger. By the bottom, you will be in the perfect state to install powerful protective measures.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step twenty. You place your foot on the first step. Beginning to descend. Boundaries already forming in your mind.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Nineteen. Another step down. Deeper relaxation. The walls of your fortress taking shape.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Eighteen. Deeper now. Every part of you welcoming protection.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Seventeen. Going deeper. The workshop coming into view.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Sixteen. Boundaries strengthening with each step.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Fifteen. Past the surface. Into deep programming territory.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Fourteen. Deeper and deeper. Your subconscious ready to receive.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Thirteen. So relaxed. So protected. So safe.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Twelve. The better you feel, the stronger your boundaries.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Eleven. Halfway there. Halfway to complete installation.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Ten. Deeper. More protected. More aware.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Nine. Each step building another layer of defense.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Eight. Deeper. More confident in your ability to stay safe.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Seven. Almost there. The workshop clearly visible now.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Six. Profound depth. Profound protection.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Five. So deep now. Boundaries becoming permanent.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Four. The workshop door ahead.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Three. The final steps.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Two. One more step.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

One. You step into the boundary workshop—a place where you build the structures that keep you safe and free.

[PAUSE 8 SECONDS]

You are now in a state of deep hypnosis where powerful boundary programming can be installed. Your conscious mind can relax while your subconscious absorbs everything it needs to protect you.

[PAUSE 8 SECONDS]

=== THERAPEUTIC CONTENT (15-18 minutes) ===

You remain in complete control. Your deeper mind will accept only the suggestions that align with your values and serve your growth. Everything else simply fades away.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

--- The Three Circles Model ---

Austin, let us begin with a powerful framework for understanding boundaries. Imagine three concentric circles, like a target.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The outermost circle is green—this is your safe zone. Everything in the green circle represents healthy behaviors, healthy environments, and healthy connections. This is where you want to spend your life.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The middle circle is yellow—this is your warning zone. Behaviors and situations in the yellow circle are not destructive in themselves, but they move you toward danger. They are the slippery slope, the path that leads to relapse.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The innermost circle is red—this is your acting out zone. Everything in the red circle represents the behaviors you are committed to avoiding. Pornography use. Masturbation to fantasy or pornographic imagery. Seeking out sexual content of any kind.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

Understanding these circles gives you a map. Your goal is to stay in the green circle as much as possible. When you notice yourself drifting toward the yellow circle, that is your cue to take action—to move back toward safety before you approach the red.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let us define your circles more specifically now.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

--- The Red Circle: Non-Negotiable Limits ---

In your red circle, place the behaviors that are absolutely off-limits. These are not up for debate. They are not situational. They are firm boundaries.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Pornography in any form—video, images, written content. This is red.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Masturbation to fantasy or memory of pornographic content. This is red.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Seeking out sexually arousing content of any kind—social media accounts, suggestive images, anything that mimics the pornography experience. This is red.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Any behavior that historically leads directly to pornography or masturbation for you. Whatever that pattern is for you specifically—it goes in the red circle.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

These red circle boundaries are not punishments. They are protection. They are the walls that keep you safe from behaviors that have caused you pain and shame.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- The Yellow Circle: Warning Signs ---

In your yellow circle, place the situations and behaviors that typically precede red circle behavior. These are your warning signs—the canary in the coal mine.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Being alone with unrestricted internet access, especially late at night. This is yellow.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Browsing the internet aimlessly, without a specific purpose. This is yellow.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Skipping accountability check-ins or isolating from your support system. This is yellow.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Allowing yourself to become too hungry, angry, lonely, or tired—the HALT states from session one. These are yellow.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Fantasy—allowing your mind to dwell on sexual scenarios, replaying memories of pornographic content, entertaining lustful thoughts. This is yellow.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Being in locations or situations where you have acted out before. These are yellow.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

When you find yourself in the yellow circle, your internal alarm should sound. This is not crisis mode—this is prevention mode. The yellow circle is where you take action before you need crisis intervention.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- The Green Circle: Your Safe Zone ---

Your green circle contains everything that supports your recovery and wellbeing.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Healthy connection with family and friends. This is green.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Physical exercise and care for your body. This is green.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Prayer, scripture study, and spiritual practices. This is green.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Productive work and meaningful projects. This is green.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Regular check-ins with your accountability partner or support system. This is green.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Adequate rest, proper nutrition, and emotional self-care. This is green.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Activities that bring genuine joy and fulfillment—hobbies, creativity, service to others. These are green.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The more time you spend in your green circle, the stronger your recovery becomes. The green circle is not about avoiding bad things—it is about filling your life with good things until there is no room for the destructive patterns.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

--- Practical Device Boundaries ---

Now let us establish practical boundaries around technology, the primary delivery system for pornography.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

First: filters. Install filtering and accountability software on every device you own. Covenant Eyes, Net Nanny, Bark, or similar programs. These create a barrier between you and pornographic content and alert your accountability partner to concerning activity.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Second: passwords. Share your device passwords with your spouse or accountability partner. The knowledge that someone else has access reduces the sense of secrecy that addiction thrives on.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Third: location. No devices in bedrooms. No devices in bathrooms. Keep technology in common areas where you are naturally accountable. If you must use a device privately, set a timer and notify someone.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Fourth: timing. No private internet use after a certain hour—perhaps 9 or 10 PM. Late night is when willpower is depleted and temptation is strongest. Build a wall around those vulnerable hours.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Fifth: purpose. Before picking up any device, ask yourself: "What am I trying to accomplish?" Mindless browsing is an open door for temptation. Purposeful use keeps you focused and safe.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

These boundaries may feel restrictive at first. But they are not prison walls—they are the walls of your fortress. Inside them, you are free.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

--- Mental and Emotional Boundaries ---

Physical boundaries are essential, but they are not sufficient alone. You must also establish boundaries in your mind.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The first mental boundary is against fantasy. When sexual fantasy begins—and it will begin—you recognize it immediately and redirect your attention. You do not entertain it, engage with it, or allow it to develop. You simply notice it and turn your mind elsewhere.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Techniques for redirecting include: praying immediately, reciting scripture or memorized text, engaging your body in physical activity, calling or texting your accountability partner, or using the HALT check to identify what you actually need.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The second mental boundary is against rationalization. The addicted mind is brilliant at creating reasons why "just this once" is acceptable. Learn to recognize these thoughts as the voice of addiction, not the voice of truth. When you hear rationalization beginning, that is your cue to reach out for help immediately.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The third mental boundary is against shame spiraling. When you feel shame, recognize that shame itself can become a trigger. The cycle goes: shame → pain → seeking relief → acting out → more shame. Break this cycle by responding to shame with grace instead of self-condemnation.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

--- Installing the Boundary Response ---

Now, let us install an automatic response that activates whenever you approach the yellow circle.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Imagine you are going about your day. Suddenly, you notice a warning sign—perhaps you are browsing aimlessly, or you feel the pull of fantasy, or you realize you are more tired and lonely than you thought.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The moment you notice this, your boundary response activates automatically.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

First, you stop. Whatever you are doing, you pause. This interrupts the momentum toward acting out.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Second, you assess. What is happening? Which HALT factor is active? What do you actually need?

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Third, you redirect. Put down the device. Leave the private space. Call someone. Pray. Go for a walk. Move your body.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Fourth, you address the underlying need. If you are hungry, eat something healthy. If you are angry, express it appropriately. If you are lonely, reach out for genuine connection. If you are tired, rest.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

This boundary response becomes automatic. Stop, assess, redirect, address. It fires before you even think about it, protecting you from crossing into the red circle.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

--- Anchor Reinforcement ---

Now, press your thumb and second finger together.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

This anchor now carries your boundaries. The three circles model. The device boundaries. The mental boundaries. The boundary response.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Whenever you need to access this protection, the anchor is available. Press thumb and second finger together, and you instantly remember: I have boundaries. I know my circles. I know what to do.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Hold the pressure. Feel the boundaries solidifying within you.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Release. The protection is installed.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Scripture Foundation ---

The Savior taught: Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

This is exactly what boundaries accomplish. They are how you watch. They keep you from entering situations where your willing spirit is overwhelmed by the weakness of the flesh.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Boundaries are not a sign of weakness. They are a sign of wisdom. They acknowledge reality: that you are a human being in a mortal body, and that certain situations make falling almost inevitable. Wisdom avoids those situations entirely.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The Lord does not ask you to stand in the fire and resist burning. He invites you to stay out of the fire entirely. Boundaries keep you out of the fire.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

--- Future Pacing ---

See yourself tomorrow. Living within your boundaries. Devices protected. Filters active. Accountability partner engaged. You move through your day with purpose and awareness.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

A week from now. The boundaries are becoming habit. You notice when you approach the yellow circle and you redirect automatically. The old patterns are weakening.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

A month from now. Your fortress is strong. The walls protect you without you having to think about them. You spend most of your time in the green circle, and it feels natural.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Six months from now. You have built a life within your boundaries—a life filled with genuine connection, meaningful work, and spiritual growth. The pornography and masturbation seem like a different life, a different person.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

A year from now. Your boundaries have become simply how you live. They are not restrictions—they are the foundation of your freedom. You are grateful for the protection they provide.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

--- Direct Suggestions ---

And now, as you rest in this deep state, your subconscious mind receives direct suggestions for boundary installation.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your boundaries are clear. You know your red circle, your yellow circle, and your green circle. This knowledge protects you automatically.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Your device boundaries are installed. Filters, passwords, locations, timing, purpose. These structures support your recovery every day.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Your mental boundaries are active. You redirect fantasy, recognize rationalization, and respond to shame with grace rather than self-condemnation.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Your boundary response is automatic. Stop, assess, redirect, address. It fires instantly whenever you approach the yellow circle.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

You honor your boundaries because they honor you. They are not prison walls but fortress walls. Inside them, you are safe and free.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

=== POST-HYPNOTIC SUGGESTIONS (2-3 minutes) ===

As you rest in this state of deep peace, your subconscious is cementing these boundaries permanently.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

In the days and weeks ahead, you will naturally maintain your boundaries. They will feel right and good—not restrictive but protective.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You will notice when you approach the yellow circle, and you will take action immediately. This will become automatic, requiring no willpower.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When temptation arises, your boundaries will hold. The fortress walls will stand. You will remain safely in your green circle.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Remember: the scripture teaches that with God, all things are possible. Your boundaries are how you cooperate with divine power. They position you to receive His strength.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== EMERGENCE (3-5 minutes) ===

And now, Austin, it is time to return to full waking consciousness. Everything you have built stays with you. Your boundaries are installed and active.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

In a moment, I will count from one to ten. With each number, you'll become more alert, more awake, more refreshed... and your boundaries will become more solid, more real, more protective.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One. Beginning to return. Boundaries coming with you.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Two. Becoming more aware of your body. The three circles clear in your mind.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Three. The room around you becoming more present. Device boundaries installed.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Four. More alert now. Mental boundaries active.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Five. Halfway back. The boundary response automatic.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Six. Your eyes may flutter. Your fortress is built.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Seven. More and more alert. Protected and prepared.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Eight. Almost there. Taking a deep, refreshing breath.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Nine. Ready to open your eyes and live within your boundaries.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Ten. Eyes open, fully awake, completely alert, and fully protected.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Welcome back, Austin. Take a moment to appreciate the work you have done. You have built boundaries that will protect you day after day.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Now the practical work begins. Install the filters today. Share the passwords. Move the devices. Establish the routines. The inner work you did in this session prepares you for the outer work you will do now.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Build your fortress. Live within its walls. Freedom awaits you there.
