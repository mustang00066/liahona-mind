PORNOGRAPHY & MASTURBATION ADDICTION - SESSION 7: Connection and Accountability
Duration: ~33 minutes
Voice: Male, British accent, calm and compassionate

[BEGIN SCRIPT]

Welcome, Austin. Today we address the power of connection. Addiction thrives in isolation. Recovery flourishes in relationship. You were never meant to fight this battle alone.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Take a deep breath in... and release.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Another breath... and release.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Close your eyes and enter hypnosis now.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Relax completely. Deep peace flowing through you. Your body at rest. Your mind open and receptive.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Descend. Ten to one. Deep hypnosis achieved.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

there is a saying in recovery circles: We are only as sick as our secrets. The addiction has likely lived in secrecy, hidden from those who love you. This secrecy has given it power.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When we bring our struggles into the light, shame loses its grip. When another human being knows our battle and still accepts us, we begin to heal. This is the power of connection.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The Savior Himself modeled this. He did not withdraw from those who struggled. He drew near to sinners, ate with them, loved them. And His presence transformed them.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You need at least one person who knows the full truth of your struggle and supports your recovery. This might be a spouse, a trusted friend, a priesthood leader, a therapist, or a recovery sponsor.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This person is your accountability partner. They are someone you can call when temptation is strong. Someone who will check in on you. Someone who celebrates your victories and lifts you after defeats.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

If you don't have such a person yet, make finding one a priority. Pray for guidance. The Lord will lead you to the right person. He wants you to have support.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

In your imagination, Austin, see yourself reaching out to this person. Whether someone you already have or someone you will find. See yourself being honest about your struggle.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

It takes courage. Your heart pounds. But you speak the truth. And instead of rejection, you receive acceptance. They don't see you as disgusting. They see you as brave for being honest.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Feel the relief that comes with that honesty. The weight you've carried alone is now shared. Someone else knows, and they still care about you. This is the beginning of freedom.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Accountability is practical as well as emotional. Regular check-ins keep you honest. Knowing you will report to someone adds weight to your choices. It is easier to say no when you know you will tell someone yes or no.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Consider establishing a check-in routine. Perhaps a daily text. Perhaps a weekly call. Something that keeps you connected and accountable. Regularity matters.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When you are tempted, you will reach out before acting. A text to your accountability partner: I am struggling right now. Just sending that message can break the spell of temptation.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

If you fall, you will tell them quickly. Not days later, not weeks later, but as soon as possible. Quick confession prevents shame from compounding. It keeps you in the light.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Support groups can also be powerful. Programs like the Church's Addiction Recovery Program, Sexaholics Anonymous, or similar groups provide community. You are surrounded by others who understand, who have walked this path.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

In such groups, you discover you are not uniquely broken. Others share your struggle. Others have found freedom. Their stories give you hope and practical wisdom.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The Lord organized His Church not as isolated individuals but as a community. We need each other. Bearing one another's burdens is part of the covenant. Let others help bear yours.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Isolation is a lie from the adversary. He wants you to believe you must struggle alone, that no one would understand, that you would be rejected if known. These are lies.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The truth is that vulnerability creates connection. When you are honest about your struggles, others often share theirs. You create space for authentic relationship.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your addiction has stolen intimacy. True connection, heart to heart, has been replaced by counterfeit. Recovery restores genuine intimacy, first with God, then with trusted others.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Imagine yourself in the future. You have a network of support. An accountability partner who knows everything. Perhaps a group who understands. You are no longer alone.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You have regular check-ins. You reach out when struggling. You confess quickly when you fall. You live in the light, and the light sustains your recovery.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This is the life that awaits you. Connected. Supported. Known. Free.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let the importance of connection sink deep into your subconscious now. You will prioritize relationship. You will be honest with at least one person. You will not walk alone.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

One... beginning to return.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Two... feeling connected.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Three... becoming alert.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Four... almost fully awake.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Five... eyes open. Reach out to someone, Austin. Let yourself be known.
