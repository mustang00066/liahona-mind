Duration: ~33 minutes
Voice: Male, British accent, calm and compassionate

[BEGIN SCRIPT]

Welcome back, Austin. Today we build healthy coping mechanisms. Pornography has been a coping tool for difficult emotions. We will replace it with tools that actually work.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Take a deep breath in... and release.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Another breath, preparing for growth... and release.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Close your eyes and enter hypnosis now, easily and deeply.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Relax from head to toe. Allow the familiar wave of peace to wash through you. Deep and complete.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Descend. Ten to one. Deep hypnosis.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

pornography has served as a way to cope with life's difficulties. Stress, loneliness, boredom, anxiety, sadness, even celebration. The brain learned: when feeling X, use pornography.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

But pornography is a terrible coping mechanism. It provides momentary escape but no resolution. The original problem remains, often made worse by the aftermath of acting out.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

True coping addresses the underlying issue. It processes the emotion rather than avoiding it. It solves the problem or accepts what cannot be changed. It leaves you better than before, not worse.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let us build a toolkit of healthy coping strategies. Different situations call for different tools. By having many options, you will always have something that works.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

First, emotional coping. When difficult feelings arise, you will learn to process them. This means feeling the feeling rather than escaping it. Emotions are like messengers; they want to deliver their message and then leave.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When sadness comes, let yourself be sad. When anger comes, let yourself feel angry. You don't need to act on the emotion destructively, but you do need to acknowledge it. Name it. I feel sad right now. I feel angry.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Prayer is powerful emotional coping. Pouring out your heart to Heavenly Father processes emotion while connecting you to divine help. He can handle your feelings, even the dark ones.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Journaling is another tool. Writing about what you feel externalizes it, gets it out of you and onto paper. This creates distance and clarity. The feeling loses some of its power.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Second, physical coping. Your body and mind are connected. Physical activity changes your mental state. Exercise releases endorphins, nature's mood boost. Even a brief walk can shift your emotional state.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When urges strike or emotions overwhelm, move your body. Go for a run. Do pushups. Take a cold shower. Clean the house vigorously. Physical action breaks mental spirals.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Sleep is also physical coping. Remember T in HALT: tired. When you are well-rested, you cope better with everything. Prioritize sleep. It is not laziness; it is self-care.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Third, social coping. We are created for connection. Isolation breeds addiction. When you are struggling, reach out. Call a friend. Visit family. Go somewhere with people.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You don't always need to talk about what you're feeling. Sometimes just being with others is enough. Their presence reminds you that you are not alone in the world.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Fourth, spiritual coping. Scripture study brings perspective and peace. Reading the words of the prophets reminds you of eternal truths that outlast temporary struggles.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Temple attendance, if available to you, brings profound peace and perspective. Even sitting in the temple lobby can center you. The temple is a place of healing.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Fifth, cognitive coping. This means changing how you think about a situation. Often our thoughts about an event cause more suffering than the event itself.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When negative thoughts spiral, question them. Is this thought true? Is it helpful? What would a wiser perspective be? Sometimes reframing a situation changes everything.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The Savior said, In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world. Tribulation is certain. But so is His overcoming. Both are true.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Now let us install these coping tools into your automatic response system. When stress arises, instead of defaulting to pornography, your mind will present healthier options.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Imagine yourself facing a stressful day. Things go wrong. Emotions build. The old pathway toward pornography begins to activate.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

But now, something new happens. Before you reach for the old coping, a menu of options appears in your mind. You could pray. You could exercise. You could call someone. You could journal. You could serve someone else.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You choose one of these healthy options. You implement it. And as you do, the emotional pressure releases in a healthy way. You feel better, actually better, not just temporarily numb.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This is your new pattern. Difficult feelings lead to healthy coping. Healthy coping leads to actual resolution. No shame, no aftermath, just genuine improvement.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The more you use healthy coping, the more automatic it becomes. The old pathway atrophies while the new pathways strengthen. In time, healthy coping will be your default.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You are not removing coping from your life. You are upgrading it. You are trading counterfeit comfort for real healing. This is wisdom. This is growth.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let all of this settle into your subconscious. The new tools are installed. The healthy options are available. You have what you need to cope with life without pornography.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

One... beginning to return.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Two... feeling equipped.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Three... becoming alert.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Four... almost fully awake.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Five... eyes open. You have real tools now, Austin. Use them.
