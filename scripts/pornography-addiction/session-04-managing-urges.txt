Duration: ~33 minutes
Voice: Male, British accent, calm and compassionate

[BEGIN SCRIPT]

Welcome back, Austin. Today you will master the art of handling urges. You will learn that urges are temporary, manageable, and ultimately powerless unless you give them power.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Take a deep breath in... and release.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Another breath, centering yourself... and release.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One more breath, and enter hypnosis now.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Relax completely. Head to toe. You know this process. Allow it to happen deeply and quickly.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Descend. Ten to one. Deep hypnosis achieved.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

an urge is a feeling. It is a sensation in your body and a thought in your mind. It is not a command. It is not an irresistible force. It is simply a wave of feeling that will pass.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This is perhaps the most important truth about urges: they always pass. Always. No urge lasts forever. If you can wait it out, it will fade. This is a biological certainty.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Most urges peak and begin to decline within fifteen to twenty minutes. Some pass faster. The intensity may rise, but it will also fall. Like a wave in the ocean, it has a beginning, a middle, and an end.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The technique called urge surfing teaches you to ride the wave. Instead of fighting the urge or giving in to it, you simply observe it. You watch it rise, notice its peak, and let it fall. You surf the wave to shore.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let us practice now. In your imagination, allow a mild urge to arise. You don't need to create a full-blown craving, just a whisper of one. Enough to work with.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Notice where you feel it in your body. Perhaps in your chest, your stomach, or elsewhere. Notice the quality of the sensation. Is it tight? Restless? Buzzing?

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Now, instead of reacting, simply observe. Say to yourself, I notice an urge arising. I am watching it. I am not acting on it.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Breathe slowly. Keep observing. The urge is not you. It is something happening in you. You are the observer, not the urge.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Notice if the urge changes. Perhaps it intensifies briefly. That is the wave rising. Keep watching. Keep breathing.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

And now notice it beginning to fade. The wave is cresting and falling. The intensity is decreasing. You did nothing but observe, and the urge is passing.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This is urge surfing. This is how you master cravings. Not by fighting, not by giving in, but by watching them pass.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The Savior was tempted in the wilderness for forty days. He did not give in. He did not panic. He simply let the temptations come and go while holding to His truth. You can do the same.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Now let us add another tool: the delay technique. When an urge strikes, commit to waiting ten minutes before doing anything. Tell yourself, I will wait ten minutes. If I still want to act then, I will reassess.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

During those ten minutes, do something else. Change your environment. Go to another room. Step outside. Call someone. Read scripture. Exercise. Anything that shifts your state.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Usually, after ten minutes, the urge has weakened significantly. You may need to delay another ten minutes. Or you may find the craving has passed entirely. Delay is powerful.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Another tool is the STOP technique. When an urge arises: S - Stop what you are doing. T - Take a breath. O - Observe the urge without acting. P - Proceed mindfully, choosing your response.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

STOP interrupts the automatic pattern. It creates a gap between stimulus and response. In that gap, you have choice. And choice is freedom.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let us also install a physical pattern interrupt. When you notice an urge, stand up and move. Physical movement changes your state. Walk around. Do jumping jacks. Splash cold water on your face. Break the physical stillness that often accompanies temptation.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Movement tells your brain, something has changed. The environment has shifted. The trance of temptation is broken by physical action.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Remember your anchor from the last session. Thumb and finger pressed together activates strength. Use it when urges arise. Feel the power flow through you.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You have multiple tools now, Austin. Urge surfing. The ten-minute delay. The STOP technique. Physical movement. Your strength anchor. Use whichever works in the moment. You are well armed.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The Apostle Paul wrote, There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

God has given you the way to escape. These tools are that way. The urges will come, but they do not have to win. You can escape. You can overcome.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Visualize yourself now, facing an urge in the future. You recognize it arising. You do not panic. You observe. You delay. You STOP. You move. You use your anchor. And the urge passes. Victory.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Each victory makes the next one easier. The pathway of resistance strengthens. The urges become weaker over time. You are building mastery.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let all of this settle into your subconscious. The tools are installed. The confidence is growing. You can handle urges. You can let them pass.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One... beginning to return.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Two... feeling capable and prepared.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Three... becoming alert.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Four... almost fully awake.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Five... eyes open. You have the tools, Austin. Use them, and you will succeed.
