Duration: ~28 minutes
Voice: Male, British accent, calm and compassionate

[BEGIN SCRIPT]

Welcome back, Austin. Today we build healthy coping mechanisms. Pornography and masturbation have been coping tools. We replace them with tools that actually work.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Take a deep breath in... and release.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Another breath, preparing for growth... and release.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One more breath... eyes closing, entering peace.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Relax from head to toe. Complete peace.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Descend now. Ten to one. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Deep hypnosis.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Austin, pornography and masturbation provide momentary escape but no resolution. True coping processes emotions rather than avoiding them.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Emotional coping: Feel the feeling. Name it. I feel sad. I feel angry. Let it pass naturally.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Prayer processes emotion while connecting you to divine help. Journaling externalizes feelings, creates clarity.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Physical coping: Move your body. Exercise releases endorphins. Walk, run, pushups. Physical action breaks mental spirals.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Sleep is coping. Remember HALT. When tired, rest.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Social coping: Reach out to others. Isolation breeds addiction. Connection heals.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Spiritual coping: Scripture study brings peace. Temple attendance brings healing.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Cognitive coping: Question negative thoughts. Is this thought true? What would a wiser perspective be?

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Imagine facing stress. The old pathway activates. But now, a menu of healthy options appears. Pray. Exercise. Call someone. Journal.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You choose a healthy option. Emotional pressure releases properly. You feel actually better, not temporarily numb.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You are upgrading your coping. Trading counterfeit comfort for real healing.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One... beginning to return.
Two... feeling equipped.
Three... becoming alert.
Four... refreshed.
Five... eyes open, fully alert. You have real tools now, Austin. Use them.
