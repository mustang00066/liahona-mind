[BEGIN SCRIPT]

Welcome, Austin. By coming to this session, you have shown tremendous courage. You are here for healing, and healing is what you will receive.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Take a deep breath in... releasing any shame or guilt.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Another breath, deeper... know that you are loved, just as you are.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One more breath... eyes closing, entering peace.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let relaxation flow through your body. Head to toe. Softening, releasing.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Descend now. Ten to one. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Deep hypnosis.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Austin, pornography addiction and the masturbation that often accompanies it are real. They affect millions. You are not alone or uniquely broken.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

These behaviors hijack the brain's reward system. Pornography and masturbation often go together in a reinforcing cycle. Each triggers the other. To find freedom, we address both together.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The brain can be rewired. What has been learned can be unlearned. You are not permanently damaged.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The addiction follows a cycle: trigger, ritual, acting out, shame, back to trigger. We will interrupt it at every point.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

HALT represents common triggers. Hungry—unmet needs. Angry—negative emotions. Lonely—disconnection. Tired—depleted willpower.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Check your HALT status daily. Address underlying needs directly. Meet needs healthily, and craving diminishes.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The Savior said, Come unto me, all ye that labour. He offers true rest, not false escape.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You now know what you face—a brain pattern, not character flaw. Change is possible.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One... beginning to return.
Two... hopeful and determined.
Three... becoming alert.
Four... refreshed.
Five... eyes open, fully alert. You have begun a sacred journey, Austin.
