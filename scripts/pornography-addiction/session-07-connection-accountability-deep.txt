=== PRE-TALK / SETTLING (2-3 minutes) ===

Welcome, Austin. You have been building essential recovery skills. Today we address something that will multiply everything you have learned: the power of connection and accountability.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

There is a saying in recovery circles: We are only as sick as our secrets. Addiction thrives in darkness and isolation. When we bring our struggles into the light—when we let others know and support us—the addiction loses its power.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Today you will understand why connection is essential to recovery, learn how to build an accountability system that works, and experience the freedom that comes from being truly known. This may feel vulnerable, but vulnerability is the gateway to healing.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Whatever fears you carry about being known—fears of rejection, judgment, or disappointment—we will address them. The reality is almost always better than the fear. Those who love you want to help. They are waiting for you to let them in.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Find a comfortable position. Allow your body to settle. This session will plant seeds of connection that will transform your recovery. Let us begin.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== INDUCTION - Eye Fatigue with Diaphragmatic Breathing (10-12 minutes) ===

Begin by finding a spot on the ceiling or wall, slightly above your natural line of sight. A spot that requires you to look upward without straining your neck.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Focus on that spot. Keep your eyes fixed there as you begin to breathe deeply. Diaphragmatic breathing—belly expanding as you breathe in, sinking as you breathe out.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Breathe in through your nose... belly rising gently... hold for a moment... and release through your mouth. With this exhale, your capacity for connection grows.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Continue gazing at that spot. Notice how your eyes begin to feel. A slight strain. A heaviness developing. This is natural and welcome. With each breath, this heaviness increases.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Another breath now... deeper than before... belly expanding... hold... and release. Isolation is dissolving. Connection is possible.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Keep your eyes on that spot. They are growing heavier. The muscles around your eyes are tiring. Some of you may notice a watering of the eyes. Others feel a pulling sensation. Both are signs that hypnosis is developing.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Breathe in once more... letting the breath fill your entire chest cavity... hold... and as you exhale, notice your eyes wanting to close. When the desire becomes strong enough, allow them to close naturally.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

If your eyes have not yet closed, take another breath and let them close with the exhale. There is no rush. Your eyes will close when they are ready.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Eyes now closed... feel the relief. The muscles that were straining are now resting. This is the first surrender—the first letting go. And it feels wonderful.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Now that your eyes are closed, bring your attention to your breathing. Allow each breath to deepen the relaxation flowing through your body.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

With your next breath, focus on your scalp. Feel it softening, relaxing. Any tension held there simply melting away. Warmth spreading across the top of your head.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

This warmth flows down to your forehead. Feel the muscles of your forehead smoothing out. All worry lines dissolving. Your forehead becoming cool, calm, completely relaxed.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Down to your eyes now—those tired muscles resting deeply. Your eyelids becoming wonderfully heavy. As though tiny weights are gently pressing them down. So heavy that you have no desire to open them.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The relaxation spreads to your cheeks and jaw. Your jaw becoming slack. Your teeth parting slightly. All the tension that accumulates in your jaw throughout the day—released now. Melting away like ice in warm water.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Down into your neck. Feel each vertebra of your neck relaxing. The muscles on the sides and back of your neck becoming loose like warm rubber. Your head feeling balanced and light.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The wave of relaxation flows into your shoulders. Shoulders are where we carry so much of life's burden. Feel yours dropping now. Releasing their load. Becoming soft and heavy.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Down through your arms. The relaxation flowing like warm honey through your upper arms... your elbows... your forearms. Into your wrists and hands. Each finger becoming loose and heavy.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Your chest now. Feel your breathing becoming even slower, even deeper. Your heart beating calmly, steadily. A sense of peace filling your entire chest cavity.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The warmth spreads through your stomach. Any knots or butterflies dissolving completely. Your stomach becoming soft and relaxed. All digestive tension released.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Into your lower back—that area that works so hard. Feel it softening. The muscles along your spine releasing their grip. Your entire back sinking into whatever supports you.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Through your hips now, releasing any tightness held there. Down into your thighs. Your large leg muscles becoming completely limp, loose, and heavy. Like lead weights.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Past your knees, into your calves. These muscles that carry you through each day—resting now. Completely at peace.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Into your ankles, your feet, your toes. Every muscle, every joint, every cell of your body now bathed in deep relaxation.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

You are deeply relaxed, Austin. Your body is at peace. Your mind is calm and receptive. With each breath, you go deeper. The better you feel, the deeper you go. The deeper you go, the more open to connection you become.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== DEEPENING - 20-Step Staircase (8-10 minutes) ===

In your mind's eye, you find yourself at the top of a beautiful staircase. This staircase has twenty steps, and it leads down to a place of deep connection—a sanctuary where you are fully known and fully loved.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The banister is smooth beneath your hand. The steps are solid and safe. With each step you descend, you will go twice as deep into hypnosis, and the walls around your heart will soften.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Step twenty. Taking the first step down. Feeling relaxation deepen. Isolation beginning to dissolve.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step nineteen. Going deeper. The world above fading. Your heart beginning to open.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step eighteen. Deeper still. Defenses softening naturally.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step seventeen. Every step takes you deeper. Every step opens you to connection.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step sixteen. Mind quieting. Heart expanding.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step fifteen. Halfway there. So deep already. So open.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step fourteen. The fear of being known is fading. Trust is building.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step thirteen. Deeper than before. Profoundly relaxed.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step twelve. Your subconscious is wide open, ready to receive.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step eleven. So peaceful. So safe. Vulnerability feels possible here.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step ten. Entering the deepest levels now. The sanctuary is near.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step nine. Every suggestion about connection will be received powerfully.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step eight. Going deeper still.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step seven. Profound openness developing.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step six. Almost there, Austin.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step five. So deep now. Walls coming down.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step four. Deeper than you have ever been.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step three. The sanctuary is just ahead.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step two. One more step.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step one. You step off the staircase into a warm, welcoming sanctuary. You are in the deepest state of hypnosis, surrounded by a sense of complete acceptance. Everything you hear will be absorbed completely by your subconscious mind.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== THERAPEUTIC CONTENT (15-18 minutes) ===

You remain in complete control. Your deeper mind will accept only the suggestions that align with your values and serve your growth. Everything else simply fades away.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

--- Isolation: The Addiction's Ally ---

Austin, let us speak a fundamental truth: addiction thrives in isolation. The adversary knows this. His strategy has always been to separate, to divide, to whisper that you must struggle alone.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Pornography is by nature a solitary behavior. It creates and requires secrecy. Masturbation compounds this isolation. Over time, a wall builds—a wall between you and the people who love you. This wall protects the addiction.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You may have told yourself you were protecting others by keeping your struggle secret. But the secrecy was protecting the addiction, not them. Addiction cannot survive in the light. When brought into community, it withers.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Scripture teaches that it is not good for man to be alone. We are designed for connection. The adversary inverts this design, offering counterfeit intimacy through a screen while stealing real intimacy from our lives.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- The Healing Power of Being Known ---

There is something deeply healing about being truly known—not the curated version we present to the world, but the real us, struggles and all.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When another person knows your battle and still accepts you, something shifts at the deepest level. Shame says, "If they knew, they would reject you." When they know and don't reject, shame loses its power.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The Savior modeled this beautifully. He did not distance Himself from sinners. He drew near. He ate with them. He touched lepers. His presence communicated: "I know what you are, and I love you still."

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This is the healing we need—to be known and loved anyway. Not because we have earned it. Not because we are perfect. But simply because love is what we deserve as children of God.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Who Should Know ---

Not everyone needs to know your struggle. But at least one person does. Perhaps a spouse—if you are married, your partner deserves to know. Perhaps a trusted friend who will not judge but will support. Perhaps a priesthood leader who can offer both spiritual and practical guidance. Perhaps a therapist or addiction counselor trained to help. Perhaps a sponsor from a recovery program.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Pray about who this person should be. The Lord will guide you. He wants you out of isolation even more than you do. Ask Him: Who should I trust with this? He will answer.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

For some of you, there may already be someone who partially knows—a spouse who discovered something, a leader you confessed to. Now is the time to deepen that transparency. Let them know the full picture. Let them know you want their help.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- The Accountability Partnership ---

An accountability partner is someone who knows the truth and actively supports your recovery. This is more than a confessor—it is a teammate.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Establish regular check-ins. Perhaps a daily text—even a simple "How are you today?" creates connection. Perhaps a weekly phone call with deeper discussion. Perhaps meeting in person on a regular schedule. Consistency matters.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your accountability partner should ask direct questions: Have you viewed pornography this week? Have you struggled with masturbation? Are you keeping your boundaries? These questions may feel uncomfortable, but discomfort is the antidote to secrecy.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Knowing you will answer these questions adds weight to your choices. When temptation arises, you remember: I will tell them if I fall. This knowledge provides an extra barrier, a pause that can save you.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Reaching Out in Crisis ---

When temptation is strong, reach out before acting. Not after—before. This is a critical practice.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

A simple text: "I am struggling right now." Those few words break the isolation. They invite intervention. Often, just sending the message releases enough pressure that the urge diminishes.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

If you cannot reach your accountability partner, reach out to someone else. Call a family member. Text a friend. Go be with people. Isolation is where temptation thrives. Connection is where it dies.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When you do reach out, you do not need to share details. You can simply say: "I am having a hard day and needed to connect." The connection itself is healing, regardless of how much you disclose.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- If You Fall, Tell Quickly ---

If a relapse does occur, tell your accountability partner quickly. Not days later. Not weeks later. As soon as possible.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Quick confession prevents shame from compounding. When we hide a fall, shame grows. The next day, it is harder to confess. Then it becomes a week. Then shame has rebuilt its kingdom.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Quick confession also prevents binge cycles. When we confess immediately, we close the door on continued acting out. We draw a line and recommit. Delayed confession leaves the door ajar.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The scripture says, He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy. Quick confession is part of quick recovery.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- The Gift of Support Groups ---

Beyond individual accountability, consider the power of support groups. Programs like the Church's Addiction Recovery Program provide community with others who understand your struggle.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

In a support group, you discover you are not uniquely broken. Others share your struggle. Others have walked the path before you and found freedom. Their stories give you hope.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

There is something powerful about hearing someone else voice your struggle. The shame that says "You are the only one" is exposed as a lie. You are not alone. Many are fighting this battle, and many are winning.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Support groups also provide a network of accountability. More people know. More people care. More people check in. The wall of isolation crumbles completely.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Vulnerability Creates Connection ---

Here is a truth that may surprise you: your vulnerability can deepen your relationships rather than destroy them.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When you share your struggle, you give others permission to share theirs. Walls come down on both sides. Authenticity creates space for authenticity.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Many who have disclosed their struggle report that their relationships actually improved. Spouses feel trusted with the truth. Friends feel honored to help. Leaders feel they can actually serve. Vulnerability builds intimacy.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Yes, there is risk. Not everyone will respond perfectly. Some may need time to process. But the alternative—living behind a wall, keeping part of yourself hidden—is a form of death. Connection is life.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Anchor Installation ---

Press your thumb and second finger together now.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

This anchor carries the power of connection. The courage to reach out. The healing of being known. The strength of accountability.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Feel all of this energy flowing into this anchor. Isolation is weakness. Connection is strength. You are designed for community. You do not have to fight alone.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Whenever you feel isolated or tempted to hide, use this anchor and remember: I can reach out. I am not alone. Connection heals.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Release the anchor now. The programming is complete.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Future Pacing: A Connected Life ---

See yourself in the future. Your accountability system is in place. You have at least one person who knows everything—who checks in regularly, who asks the hard questions, who celebrates your victories.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When temptation arises, you reach out before acting. The urge loses power in the light of connection. Isolation no longer traps you because you have broken its hold.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Perhaps you are part of a support group. Perhaps you sponsor others. The isolation that once defined your struggle is now a distant memory. You live in the light.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your relationships are deeper than ever. The walls are gone. People know you—really know you—and they love what they know. The fear of rejection has been replaced by the reality of acceptance.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This future is not fantasy. It is forming now. Every connection you make, every vulnerability you risk, every check-in you complete brings it closer.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Scriptural Foundation ---

The scripture teaches: Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ. This is not weakness—it is the gospel way. We are meant to share burdens, to lift each other, to never walk alone.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When we isolate, we violate this divine design. When we connect, we fulfill it. Your recovery is not just about you—it is about participating in the body of Christ as He intended.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The Savior Himself, in His darkest hour, wanted companions. He asked Peter, James, and John to watch with Him. He understood the need for connection. Let yourself need it too.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== POST-HYPNOTIC SUGGESTIONS (2-3 minutes) ===

Your subconscious now holds the truth: isolation fuels addiction; connection heals it. This understanding will shape your choices automatically.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You will feel a natural pull toward connection. When temptation arises, reaching out will become instinctive. The desire to hide will be replaced by the courage to be known.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

If you do not yet have an accountability partner, you will take action to find one. The Spirit will guide you. You will follow His prompting.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your relationships will deepen. The walls you have built are coming down. Vulnerability is no longer your enemy—it is your ally.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Every day, your capacity for connection increases. Every day, isolation loses its grip. You are becoming someone who lives in the light.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== EMERGENCE (3-5 minutes) ===

It is time to return to full awareness, carrying the gift of connection with you.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

In a moment, I will count from one to ten. With each number, you will become more alert, more awake, while everything you have learned remains active in your subconscious.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One. Beginning the journey back. Connection programming complete.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Two. Feeling energy returning to your body. Gentle movement returning to your fingers and toes.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Three. Becoming aware of your surroundings. The room around you becoming more present.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Four. Your mind clearing. A sense of refreshment spreading through you.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Five. Halfway back now. Feeling wonderful. Connected.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Six. More alert with each breath. Energy building.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Seven. Almost there. Feeling ready to reach out.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Eight. Eyes preparing to open. Clarity increasing.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Nine. Nearly fully awake. Taking a deep, energizing breath.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Ten. Eyes open, fully alert, completely refreshed, and ready to connect.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Welcome back, Austin. You no longer walk alone. Reach out to someone today. Let yourself be known. Connection is the antidote to isolation—and connection will carry you to freedom.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

The people who love you want to help. Let them in. Let them know. Let them walk beside you. Together, you will overcome.
