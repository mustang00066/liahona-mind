[BEGIN SCRIPT]

Welcome, Austin. By coming to this session, you have shown tremendous courage. Many struggle in silence, but you have chosen to seek healing. The Savior honors that choice.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Find a comfortable position. This is a safe space, free from judgment. You are here for healing.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Take a deep breath in... and let it go, releasing any shame or guilt you carry.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Another breath, deeper... and as you exhale, know that you are loved, just as you are.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

One more breath, and let your eyes close, entering peace where transformation can begin.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let relaxation flow through your body. Head, face, neck, shoulders softening. Arms, chest, stomach releasing. Hips, legs, feet at peace.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Now, the staircase. Twenty steps down into openness and healing.

Twenty, nineteen, eighteen, seventeen, sixteen... going deeper.
Fifteen, fourteen, thirteen, twelve, eleven... shame releasing.
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six... mind opening.
Five, four, three, two, one... deep hypnosis achieved.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

today we understand what you face. Pornography addiction and the masturbation that often accompanies it are real. They affect millions, including many faithful Church members. You are not alone or uniquely broken.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

These behaviors hijack the brain's reward system. They release dopamine, the same chemical in other addictions. The brain becomes conditioned to seek this artificial stimulation. This is not moral failure—it is a neurological pattern.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Pornography and masturbation often go together in a reinforcing cycle. Each behavior triggers and intensifies the other. To find freedom, we address both together. They are symptoms of the same underlying need for connection, relief, or escape.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

But here is hope: the brain can be rewired. What has been learned can be unlearned. Neuroplasticity that created the addiction can heal it. You are not permanently damaged.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Understanding removes shame. You are not a bad person. You are a good person with brain patterns that need to change. The Savior sees your heart.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The addiction follows a cycle: trigger, ritual, acting out, shame and guilt, which leads back to trigger. A vicious cycle. We will interrupt it at every point.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The acronym HALT represents common triggers. H—Hungry, any unmet need. A—Angry, negative emotions. L—Lonely, disconnection. T—Tired, depleted willpower.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

From now on, you will check your HALT status daily. When you notice any state, address the underlying need directly. If hungry, identify what you truly need. If angry, process it. If lonely, reach out. If tired, rest.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Addressing real needs removes fuel for addiction. Pornography and masturbation were never about themselves—they were about meeting needs unhealthily. Meet needs in healthy ways, and craving diminishes.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The Savior said, Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. He offers true rest, not false escape.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

In coming sessions, you will build boundaries, rewire your brain, develop healthy coping, build accountability, and transform your identity from someone who struggles to someone who is free.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Today, we plant seeds. You know what you face—a brain pattern, not a character flaw. You know the cycle. You know triggers. Change is possible.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The Lord has not abandoned you. Even in darkness, He waited. Now you have turned to Him. This is the beginning of liberation.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

As I count from one to ten, return to waking awareness.

One... beginning to return.
Two... hopeful and determined.
Three... becoming alert.
Four... refreshed.
Five... halfway back.
Six... alertness increasing.
Seven... feeling wonderful.
Eight... almost there.
Nine... nearly awake.
Ten... eyes open, fully alert. You have begun a sacred journey, Austin.
