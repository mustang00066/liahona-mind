=== PRE-TALK / SETTLING (2-3 minutes) ===

Welcome, Austin. By coming to this session, you have shown tremendous courage. Many struggle in silence with pornography and masturbation, but you have chosen to seek healing. The Savior honors that choice, and so do I.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Find a comfortable position now, whether sitting or lying down. Allow your body to settle into stillness. This is a safe space, completely free from judgment. You are not here to be condemned. You are here for understanding and healing.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Over these ten sessions, you will come to understand this challenge in a new way. You will build boundaries, rewire your brain, develop healthy coping, heal from shame, build accountability, and transform your identity. This first session focuses on understanding—because clarity removes shame and empowers change.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Take a moment to acknowledge your courage in being here. Whatever you have struggled with, whatever you have done, you are taking a step toward freedom. That matters. That counts. Let us begin.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== INDUCTION - Eye Fatigue and Diaphragmatic Breathing (10-12 minutes) ===

Before we close your eyes, find a spot above your natural line of sight. Perhaps on the ceiling... or high on the wall ahead. Focus your eyes on that spot now.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Notice how this upward gaze begins to tire your eye muscles. As your eyes fatigue, defenses begin to soften. You are becoming ready to receive understanding without shame.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

As you hold this gaze, begin your diaphragmatic breathing. Belly breathing... when you breathe in, your belly expands. When you breathe out, your belly button sinks toward your spine.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Breathe in deeply through your nose... let your belly rise... hold for a moment... and release slowly through your mouth. With each exhale, release any shame or guilt you carry. It is safe to let it go here.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

This breathing stimulates your vagus nerve, activating your body's natural calming response. You are becoming receptive to healing truth.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Take another deep belly breath. Your eyes still focused upward... heavier... more tired. Breathe in... belly expanding... hold... and release. You are entering a space of compassionate understanding.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

One more breath. And as you exhale this time, allow your eyes to close. Let them fall shut with relief. You are entering a state of deep receptivity.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Good. Now imagine your neck becoming like a bundle of loose rubber bands. All tension dissolving. Your head floating gently... like a helium balloon.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Allow your jaws to sag. Your mouth opening slightly. Your tongue resting loosely. The forehead smoothing out completely. Any shame or tension in your face releasing.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let your shoulders sag completely. Shoulders dropping... dropping... as low as they can go. The weight of shame and secrecy falling away.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

Your arms becoming limp, loose, and heavy. So limp, so loose, so heavy. Your hands at peace. You are safe here.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

Your legs and feet now. Let them go limp, loose, and heavy.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

The better you feel, the deeper you go. The deeper you go, the better you feel. And the more clearly you can understand what you face.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

It feels so good to just relax. It feels so good to just breathe. It feels so good to know that understanding brings freedom.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Your eyelids now... so relaxed they've become wonderfully heavy. As though gently stuck together. This heaviness is safety. This heaviness is healing.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

From head to toe, you are deeply relaxed. Your body is at peace. Your mind is open. You are ready to understand.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== DEEPENING (8-10 minutes) ===

Now, imagine yourself at the top of a staircase. This staircase leads down to a sanctuary of understanding... a place where you can see clearly without shame, where truth brings freedom rather than condemnation.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

There are twenty steps. With each step, you go deeper into receptivity. By the bottom, you will be ready to truly understand what you face—not as a moral failure, but as a pattern that can be changed.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step twenty. You place your foot on the first step. Already understanding is dawning.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Nineteen. Another step down. Shame beginning to lift.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Eighteen. Deeper now. Clarity growing.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Seventeen. Going deeper. Judgment fading.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Sixteen. Compassion for yourself increasing.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Fifteen. Past the surface. Into understanding.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Fourteen. Deeper and deeper. Truth becoming visible.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Thirteen. So safe. So ready to see clearly.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Twelve. The sanctuary of understanding coming into view.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Eleven. Your subconscious opening to healing truth.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Ten. Halfway there. Halfway to complete understanding.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Nine. Every layer of shame dissolving.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Eight. Deeper. More open. More compassionate toward yourself.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Seven. Almost there. The sanctuary waiting.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Five. So deep now. So ready for healing understanding.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Four. Old shame patterns losing their grip.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Three. The final steps.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Two. One more step.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

One. You step into the sanctuary of understanding.

[PAUSE 8 SECONDS]

You are now in a place of complete safety and clarity. Here, you can understand what you face without shame. Here, truth liberates rather than condemns. Here, you can see yourself as God sees you—not as your worst moments, but as His beloved child who is learning and growing.

[PAUSE 8 SECONDS]

=== THERAPEUTIC CONTENT (15-18 minutes) ===

You remain in complete control. Your deeper mind will accept only the suggestions that align with your values and serve your growth. Everything else simply fades away.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

--- Understanding the Challenge ---

Austin, let us begin with an important truth: you are not uniquely broken. Millions of people—including many faithful members of the Church—struggle with pornography and masturbation. This is one of the most common challenges of our time, amplified by technology that puts temptation literally in our pockets.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The fact that you struggle does not make you a bad person. It makes you human, living in an age of unprecedented sexual stimulation. Understanding this removes the first layer of shame.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Pornography and masturbation often go together in a reinforcing cycle. Each behavior can trigger and intensify the other. To find lasting freedom, we address them together, because they are often symptoms of the same underlying needs—needs for connection, relief from stress, escape from difficult emotions, or simply the powerful pull of brain chemistry.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

--- The Brain Science ---

Let us understand what happens in the brain. This knowledge removes shame because it shows that you are dealing with real neurological patterns, not simply a character flaw.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When you view pornography or engage in masturbation, your brain releases a flood of chemicals—dopamine, oxytocin, endorphins. These are the same chemicals involved in pair bonding, in love, in the deepest human pleasures. Your brain is designed to seek these experiences.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The problem is that pornography provides a supernormal stimulus—an intensity of stimulation that natural experiences cannot match. The brain becomes conditioned to this artificial intensity. Regular pleasures seem dull by comparison.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Over time, the brain adapts. It needs more stimulation to get the same effect. This is called tolerance—the same phenomenon that happens with drugs. You may have noticed needing more extreme content or longer sessions to feel satisfied. This is not moral decay—it is brain chemistry.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The good news is that the brain can heal. This is called neuroplasticity—the brain's ability to rewire itself. The same mechanisms that created the patterns can undo them. New pathways can form. Old pathways can weaken. Your brain is not permanently damaged.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

--- The Addiction Cycle ---

Every addiction follows a predictable cycle. Understanding this cycle gives you power over it.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

First comes the trigger. Something activates the desire—stress, loneliness, boredom, seeing something arousing, or simply being in a place where you usually act out.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Next comes the ritual. The behaviors that lead up to acting out—perhaps going to a private location, opening certain apps, entering a particular mental state.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Then comes the acting out itself—viewing pornography, masturbating, or both.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

After the acting out comes the shame and guilt. The crash. The promises that it will never happen again. The hiding, the covering up, the self-condemnation.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

And here is the cruel twist: shame and guilt are themselves triggers. They create the emotional pain that drives you back to the behavior for relief. The cycle feeds itself.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

To break this cycle, we must interrupt it at every point. We will learn to recognize triggers, disrupt rituals, develop competing responses, and—most importantly—heal the shame that keeps the cycle spinning.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

--- The HALT Framework ---

There is an acronym that captures common triggers: HALT. Learning to check your HALT status is one of the most practical tools you will develop.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

H stands for Hungry. This means any unmet need—not just physical hunger, but emotional, spiritual, or relational hunger. When needs are unmet, we seek whatever relief is available.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

A stands for Angry. This includes any negative emotion—frustration, irritation, resentment, hurt. Difficult emotions often precede acting out because the behavior provides temporary escape.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

L stands for Lonely. Disconnection from others is a primary driver of addiction. We are wired for connection, and when connection is absent, we substitute.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

T stands for Tired. When you are depleted, willpower is weakened. Late nights, exhaustion, and stress all lower your defenses.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

From this day forward, you will develop the habit of checking your HALT status. When you notice any of these states, you will address the underlying need directly—eat if hungry, process if angry, connect if lonely, rest if tired. Addressing real needs removes fuel for the addiction.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

--- What the Behavior Is Really About ---

Here is a profound truth, Austin: pornography and masturbation were never really about sex. They were about meeting needs in an unhealthy way.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Perhaps the behavior provides escape—a way to check out from stress, from difficult emotions, from the demands of life.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Perhaps it provides comfort—a reliable source of pleasure when other comforts are unavailable.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Perhaps it provides connection—a substitute for intimacy when real connection feels risky or impossible.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Perhaps it provides excitement—a dopamine hit in an otherwise mundane existence.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Perhaps it provides control—something that is entirely yours when other areas of life feel out of control.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

As you come to understand which needs the behavior has been meeting, you can begin to meet those needs in healthy ways. This is the path to lasting freedom—not just stopping a behavior, but addressing what drove it.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

--- You Are Not Your Behavior ---

The most destructive aspect of this struggle is often not the behavior itself, but the shame surrounding it. Shame says: "I am bad. I am broken. I am unworthy of love."

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

But shame is a liar. Your behavior does not define you. You are not your worst moments. You are a child of God with infinite, inherent worth that cannot be diminished by any action.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The Savior did not come for the righteous. He came for sinners. He came for the broken, the struggling, the ashamed. He came for you, Austin. His love for you has never wavered, not even in your darkest moments.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

As you go through these sessions, you will learn to separate your identity from your behavior. You will learn to feel guilt for actions without feeling shame about your worth. You will discover that you can change what you do without believing you are fundamentally flawed.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

--- The Path Forward ---

Over the coming sessions, you will build a complete system for freedom.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You will learn to build boundaries—practical barriers that interrupt the cycle before it begins.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You will learn techniques for rewiring the brain—replacing the addiction pathways with healthier patterns.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You will develop skills for managing urges—riding them out without acting on them.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You will heal from shame—the core wound that keeps so many trapped.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You will develop healthy coping mechanisms—better ways to meet the needs the addiction has been serving.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You will build connection and accountability—the antidote to the isolation where addiction thrives.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You will transform your identity—becoming someone who is free, not someone who is fighting.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You will learn relapse prevention—how to maintain freedom for life.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

This is a comprehensive program. If you do the work, freedom is not just possible—it is inevitable.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

--- Direct Suggestions ---

And now, as you rest in this deeply receptive state, your subconscious mind is ready to receive foundational truths.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You understand what you face—a brain pattern, not a character flaw. A learned behavior that can be unlearned. A cycle that can be interrupted.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

You release the belief that you are uniquely broken. Millions share this struggle. You are not alone. You are not a monster. You are human.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

You begin to separate your worth from your behavior. Your actions can change. Your worth is eternal and unchangeable.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You commit to checking your HALT status daily. When you notice hunger, anger, loneliness, or tiredness, you address the need directly.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

You know that the Savior is with you in this journey. He has not abandoned you. He is the source of your healing.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

--- Establishing the Anchor ---

Let us establish an anchor that will grow throughout these sessions.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Press your thumb and second finger of your right hand together now.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

As you hold this pressure, feel understanding flowing into your fingers. This gesture carries the truth you have received today—that you are not broken, that change is possible, that you are worthy of freedom.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Hold the pressure. Thumb and second finger together means: I understand. I am not my behavior. I am worthy of healing.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

Release. The anchor is established. Use it whenever you need to reconnect with these truths. It will grow stronger with each session.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Future Pacing ---

See yourself tomorrow. Going about your normal activities. And you notice something different—a new understanding. When temptation whispers, you remember: this is a brain pattern, not who I am. I can learn new patterns.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

A week from now. You have been checking your HALT status. You are catching triggers early. The cycle is becoming visible to you, and visibility brings power.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

A month from now. You have completed many sessions. You have new tools, new understanding, new patterns forming. Freedom is becoming real.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

A year from now. This struggle is behind you. You have rebuilt your brain, your habits, your identity. You are someone who is free. Looking back, you can see how this journey made you stronger, more self-aware, more compassionate.

[PAUSE 8 SECONDS]

=== POST-HYPNOTIC SUGGESTIONS (2-3 minutes) ===

As you rest in this peaceful state, your subconscious is integrating everything. Understanding is taking root.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

In the days ahead, you will notice increased awareness of your triggers and the cycle. This is not creating problems—it is illuminating what was always there. Awareness is power.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Each time you listen to this series, your understanding deepens. Your commitment strengthens. Your path to freedom becomes clearer.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The Savior said, Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. He offers true rest—not the false escape of addiction, but genuine peace.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Remember: you are not alone in this struggle. You are not uniquely broken. And freedom is absolutely possible for you.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== EMERGENCE (3-5 minutes) ===

And now, Austin, it's time to return to full waking consciousness. The understanding you've gained here comes with you. The shame you've released stays behind.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

In a moment, I will count from one to ten. With each number, you'll become more alert, more awake, more refreshed... while keeping your new understanding.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One. Beginning to return. Understanding coming with you.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Three. The room around you becoming more present. Your knowledge intact.

Four. More alert now. Energy returning to your body.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Five. Halfway back. Feeling hopeful and determined.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Six. Your eyes may flutter. Your body preparing to return.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Seven. More and more alert. Feeling worthy and capable.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Eight. Almost there. Taking a deep, refreshing breath.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Nine. Ready to open your eyes and begin your journey to freedom.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Ten. Eyes open, fully awake, completely alert, and ready to heal.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Welcome back, Austin. Take a moment to appreciate that you have begun something important. You now understand this challenge in a new way. You know it is a pattern, not a character flaw. You know the cycle. You know the triggers.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

In the coming days, simply notice. Notice your triggers. Notice the cycle. Notice your HALT status. Awareness is the foundation of everything that follows.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

You have begun a sacred journey, Austin. The Lord has not abandoned you. He is with you every step of the way. Trust the process. Trust in divine help. You will find freedom.
