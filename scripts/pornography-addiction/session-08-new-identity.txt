Duration: ~33 minutes
Voice: Male, British accent, calm and compassionate

[BEGIN SCRIPT]

Welcome, Austin. Today we focus on identity transformation. You are not just stopping a behavior. You are becoming a new person. A person for whom this addiction is foreign.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Take a deep breath in... and release.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Another breath, connecting to who you are becoming... and release.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Close your eyes and enter hypnosis now.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Relax completely. Allow peace to fill every part of you. Deep hypnosis coming quickly.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Descend. Ten to one. Deep state achieved.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

identity drives behavior. If you see yourself as an addict struggling to resist, resistance is constant effort. But if you see yourself as a free man who simply does not do this thing, freedom is natural.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Consider a person who has never smoked. They don't struggle to resist cigarettes. It's not willpower; it's identity. Smoking simply isn't something they do.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You are transitioning from someone who fights pornography to someone for whom pornography is simply not an option. This is not denial. It is a genuine change in who you are.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The old identity was shaped by many factors: circumstances, perhaps trauma, brain chemistry, habit. But identity can be chosen. You get to decide who you want to be. And that decision, reinforced over time, becomes reality.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

In the gospel, we call this becoming a new creature in Christ. The old man is put off, the new man is put on. This is not just metaphor. It is actual psychological transformation.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

So who are you becoming? Let us define this clearly.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

You are becoming a man of integrity. Your private life matches your public life. You have nothing to hide. You walk in the light.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

You are becoming a man of self-mastery. Your appetites do not control you. You control them. You are the master of your own house.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

You are becoming a man of connection. You value real relationships over counterfeit intimacy. You invest in people, not pixels.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

You are becoming a man of service. Your energy goes toward blessing others, not escaping into fantasy. You make a difference in the world.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

You are becoming a man of faith. You rely on the Savior. You access His enabling power. You are an instrument in His hands.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This is who you are becoming. Feel it. Own it. Let this identity settle into every fiber of your being.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

In your imagination, step into this future. See him in his daily life. He wakes with purpose. He connects with his Heavenly Father. He moves through his day with confidence and peace.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When he encounters triggers, they barely register. They are remnants of an old life, distant memories. He is no longer that person. Temptation has no foothold because identity has changed.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

See him in his relationships. Present. Engaged. Not distracted by secret struggles. He gives his full attention because he has nothing stealing it away.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

See him at night, going to bed with a clear conscience. No shame, no secrecy. He rests peacefully, whole and integrated. This is freedom.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This future Austin is not fantasy. He is emerging. With every session you complete, every day of sobriety, every tool you use, he becomes more real. You are already becoming him.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Merge with this future self now. Let his identity become your identity. Let his confidence become your confidence. Let his freedom become your freedom.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

You are not pretending. You are claiming what is already happening. The transformation is real. The new creature is emerging.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The Savior said, Ye must be born again. You are being born again. The old self, bound by addiction, is dying. The new self, free and whole, is rising.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When temptation comes in the future, respond from this new identity. Say to yourself, I am not someone who does that. That is not who I am. And mean it. And it will be true.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The language of identity is powerful. Instead of I am trying not to use pornography, say I am someone who does not use pornography. Instead of I hope I can resist, say I am free from this.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Speak your new identity into existence. Believe it before you fully feel it. Act as if it is true, and it will become true.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

you are a new creation. The old is passing away. The new has come. Walk in this newness of life.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let this identity transformation settle deep into your subconscious. You know who you are now. You know who you are becoming. Nothing can shake this foundation.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

One... beginning to return.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Two... carrying your new identity.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Three... becoming alert.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Four... almost fully awake.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Five... eyes open. You are a new creation, Austin. Live like it.
