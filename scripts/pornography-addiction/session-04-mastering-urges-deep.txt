=== PRE-TALK / SETTLING (2-3 minutes) ===

Welcome back, Austin. Find a comfortable position now and allow yourself to settle into stillness. You have been doing important work, and today you add essential skills to your recovery toolkit.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

In our previous sessions, you learned about the nature of addiction, built protective boundaries, and understood how your brain is rewiring itself. Today we focus on something you will need again and again: the ability to master urges.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Urges will come. This is not failure—it is simply how addiction works. The addiction pathways in your brain will fire from time to time, especially in the early stages of recovery. What matters is not whether urges arise, but how you respond to them.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Today you will learn that urges are temporary, manageable, and ultimately powerless unless you give them power. You will gain specific techniques for riding out urges without acting on them. Each urge you master weakens the addiction and strengthens your freedom.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let us begin this training in urge mastery.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== INDUCTION - Eye Fatigue and Diaphragmatic Breathing (10-12 minutes) ===

Before we close your eyes, find a spot above your natural line of sight. Perhaps on the ceiling... or high on the wall ahead of you. Focus your eyes on that spot now.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Notice how this upward gaze begins to tire your eye muscles. This eye fatigue prepares you for the deep work of installing urge-mastery skills. As your eyes grow heavier, your mind opens to new learning.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

As you hold this gaze, begin your diaphragmatic breathing. Belly breathing... when you breathe in, your belly expands like a balloon filling with air. When you breathe out, your belly button sinks toward your spine.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Breathe in deeply through your nose... let your belly rise... hold for a moment... and release slowly through your mouth. With each exhale, your capacity for mastery increases.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

This breathing stimulates your vagus nerve, activating your body's natural calm. You are entering a state where urge-management skills become automatic.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Take another deep belly breath. Your eyes still focused upward... heavier now... more tired. Breathe in... belly expanding... hold... and release. You are becoming a master of urges.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

Your eyelids are growing so heavy. Like weights are attached to them. Allow this heaviness to deepen with each breath.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

One more breath. And as you exhale this time, allow your eyes to close. Let them fall shut with relief. Your eyes are closed now, and you are ready to learn mastery.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Good. Now imagine your neck becoming like a bundle of loose rubber bands. All tension dissolving. Your head floating gently... weightless... like a helium balloon.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Allow your jaws to sag. Your mouth opening slightly. Your tongue resting loosely on the floor of your mouth. The forehead smoothing out completely.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let your shoulders sag completely. All the weight you carry there... dropping away. Shoulders sinking... sinking... as low as they can possibly go.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

Your arms becoming limp, loose, and heavy. So limp, so loose, so heavy. From shoulders to fingertips, complete relaxation.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

Your hands, Austin. These hands that are learning new responses. Feel them completely at rest.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Now your legs and feet. Allow them to become limp, loose, and heavy. So limp, so loose, so heavy.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

The better you feel, the deeper you go. The deeper you go, the more powerful your urge mastery becomes.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

It feels so good to just relax. It feels so good to just breathe. It feels so good to know that you are becoming a master of urges.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Your eyelids now... so relaxed they've become wonderfully heavy. As though stuck together with gentle glue. They are at peace.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

From head to toe, you are deeply relaxed. Your body is at peace. Your mind is ready to learn. Let us go deeper.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== DEEPENING (8-10 minutes) ===

Now, imagine yourself at the top of a staircase. This staircase leads down to a training ground—a place where urge-mastery skills are installed and practiced.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

There are twenty steps. With each step, you go deeper and your mastery strengthens. By the bottom, you will have powerful tools for handling any urge that arises.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step twenty. You place your foot on the first step. Beginning to descend. Mastery skills already forming.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Nineteen. Another step down. Deeper relaxation. Your capacity for handling urges increasing.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Eighteen. Deeper now. Every part of you learning urge mastery.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Seventeen. Going deeper. The training ground coming into view.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Sixteen. Your urge-handling skills strengthening.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Fifteen. Past the surface. Into deep mastery territory.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Fourteen. Deeper and deeper. Tools installing automatically.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Thirteen. So relaxed. So capable. So ready.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Twelve. The better you feel, the more powerful your mastery.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Eleven. Halfway there. Halfway to complete skill installation.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Ten. Deeper. More capable. More confident.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Nine. Each step building another layer of mastery.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Eight. Deeper. You can handle any urge.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Seven. Almost there. The training ground clearly visible now.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Six. Profound depth. Profound capability.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Five. So deep now. Mastery becoming permanent.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Four. The training ground ahead.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Three. The final steps.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Two. One more step.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

One. You step into the training ground of urge mastery—a place where you gain power over every urge that will ever arise.

[PAUSE 8 SECONDS]

You are now in a state of deep hypnosis where urge-mastery skills are installed permanently. Your conscious mind can relax while your subconscious absorbs these powerful tools.

[PAUSE 8 SECONDS]

=== THERAPEUTIC CONTENT (15-18 minutes) ===

You remain in complete control. Your deeper mind will accept only the suggestions that align with your values and serve your growth. Everything else simply fades away.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

--- Understanding the Nature of Urges ---

Austin, let us begin with the most important truth about urges: they are temporary. They always pass. Always.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

An urge is a feeling. It is a sensation in your body and a thought in your mind. It is not a command. It is not an irresistible force. It is simply a wave that will rise, peak, and fall—like every wave in every ocean since the beginning of time.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

This is a biological certainty. No urge lasts forever. No craving maintains peak intensity indefinitely. If you wait it out, it will fade. This is how the nervous system works.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Most urges peak within fifteen to twenty minutes, then decline. Some may have multiple peaks. But eventually, inevitably, every urge subsides. This is the truth you can count on.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

In the moment, an urge may feel overwhelming, as if you cannot survive without giving in. This is a lie the addiction tells. You can survive. You will survive. And on the other side of the urge is freedom.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

--- Urge Surfing: Riding the Wave ---

There is a technique called urge surfing that teaches you to ride the wave of urges rather than being swept away by them.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Instead of fighting the urge—which often makes it stronger—and instead of giving in—which reinforces the addiction—you simply observe. You watch the urge like a scientist observing a phenomenon. Curious. Detached. Present.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let us practice urge surfing now. In your imagination, allow a mild urge to arise. Just a whisper of one—enough to work with, but not overwhelming.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Notice where you feel this urge in your body. Perhaps it is a tightness in your chest. A restlessness in your stomach. A buzzing sensation somewhere. Locate it in your body.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Do not try to make it go away. Simply observe it. Say to yourself: "I notice an urge arising. I am watching it. I am not acting on it."

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Breathe slowly. Keep observing. The urge is not you. It is something happening within you. You are the observer—the awareness that watches—not the urge itself.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Notice if the urge changes. Perhaps it intensifies briefly. That is the wave rising toward its peak. Keep watching. Keep breathing. You are surfing this wave.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

And now notice it beginning to fade. The wave is cresting and falling. You did nothing but observe, and the urge is passing. This is urge surfing.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Each time you surf an urge, you prove to yourself and to your brain that urges do not control you. They are just temporary visitors that come and go. You remain.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

--- The Delay Technique ---

Another powerful tool is the delay technique. When an urge strikes, simply commit to waiting a set period of time before doing anything.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Tell yourself: "I will wait ten minutes before making any decision." Or twenty minutes. Or an hour. The specific time matters less than the commitment to delay.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

During those minutes, do something else. Change your environment—go to another room, step outside, take a walk. Call someone. Read something uplifting. Exercise. Pray.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The key is that you are not saying "no" forever—you are just saying "not yet." This takes the pressure off the decision. And almost always, by the time the delay period ends, the urge has weakened significantly or passed entirely.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Delay works because urges rely on immediacy. The addiction wants you to act now, before you have time to think. Delay disrupts this pattern and gives your prefrontal cortex time to regain control.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

--- The STOP Technique ---

Here is another technique you can use anytime an urge arises. It is called STOP.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

S stands for Stop. The moment you notice an urge, you stop whatever you are doing. Just pause. This interrupts the automatic chain from trigger to behavior.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

T stands for Take a breath. Take one slow, deep breath. This activates your parasympathetic nervous system and creates a moment of calm in which you can choose.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

O stands for Observe. Observe the urge without judging it. Notice it in your body. Notice the thoughts accompanying it. Observe without acting.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

P stands for Proceed mindfully. Now choose your response deliberately. What will you do? What action aligns with your values and goals? Proceed with intention, not impulse.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

STOP creates a gap between stimulus and response. In that gap, you have choice. And choice is the essence of freedom.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Practice STOP regularly, even when urges are not present. Make it a habit. Then when urges do arise, the technique will be automatic.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

--- Physical Movement ---

Physical movement is a powerful urge-breaker. When an urge strikes, moving your body tells your brain that something has changed—that the situation requiring the urge is over.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Stand up. Walk around. Do jumping jacks or push-ups. Take a cold shower or splash cold water on your face. Go outside and walk briskly around the block.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Cold water is particularly effective. It triggers a shock response that resets your nervous system. Even just running cold water over your wrists or splashing your face can break the momentum of an urge.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Exercise releases natural dopamine—the same chemical pornography hijacked. By moving your body, you give your brain a healthy dose of what it was seeking unhealthily. This satisfies the craving in a legitimate way.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

--- Play the Tape Forward ---

There is a technique called "play the tape forward" that helps you see past the urge to its consequences.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When an urge arises, your mind focuses on the immediate pleasure it promises. But what comes after? Play the full tape forward.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Imagine acting on the urge. What happens next? The temporary pleasure fades quickly. Then what? The shame. The guilt. The empty feeling. The broken promises. The distance from God. The damage to your marriage, your self-respect, your integrity.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Now imagine not acting on the urge. What happens? The urge fades. You feel strong. You go to bed with peace instead of shame. You wake up proud instead of defeated. Your freedom strengthens.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Playing the tape forward reminds you of the true cost of acting out and the true reward of resisting. The urge shows you only the first frame. You must remember the whole film.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

--- Substitution Activities ---

When urges arise, having substitute activities ready is essential. These are healthy behaviors you can turn to instead of acting out.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Prepare a list of substitutes that work for you. This might include: calling a friend or accountability partner, exercise or physical activity, going to a public place, prayer or scripture study, a creative project, time with family, a walk in nature.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The key is to have these substitutes identified in advance. In the heat of an urge is not the time to brainstorm alternatives. Know your substitutes. Make them accessible. Use them.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Over time, these healthy substitutes will become your new pathways. The brain will learn: when this trigger fires, I do this healthy behavior instead. This is neuroplasticity in action.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

--- Anchor Reinforcement ---

Now, press your thumb and second finger together.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

This anchor now carries urge mastery. Urge surfing. Delay. STOP. Physical movement. Play the tape forward. Substitution.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Whenever an urge arises, use this anchor. Press thumb and second finger together and remember: I am a master of urges. This will pass. I have tools.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Hold the pressure. Feel mastery flowing through you.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Release. The skills are installed.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Scripture of Overcoming ---

The Apostle Paul wrote: God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

This is a promise. No temptation, no urge, will ever be beyond your ability to handle. There is always a way of escape. The techniques you learned today are that way.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The Savior Himself was tempted in the wilderness for forty days. He did not give in. He did not panic. He simply let the temptations come and go while holding to His truth. You can do the same.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

With divine help and these practical tools, you can master any urge that arises. Not through white-knuckling, but through skill, wisdom, and grace.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

--- Future Pacing ---

See yourself tomorrow. An urge arises. You recognize it immediately. You surf it calmly. It passes. You are free.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

A week from now. You have surfed multiple urges. Each one easier than the last. Your confidence is growing. Urges are losing their power.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

A month from now. Urges are less frequent, less intense. When they do come, you handle them effortlessly. Urge mastery has become second nature.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Six months from now. You barely remember what overwhelming urges felt like. The addiction's grip has released. You are simply free.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

A year from now. You have tools for life. Not just for this addiction, but for any urge, any temptation, any challenge. You have become a master.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

--- Direct Suggestions ---

And now, as you rest in this deep state, your subconscious mind receives direct suggestions for permanent urge mastery.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Urges are temporary. They always pass. You know this with certainty. No urge can last forever. No urge can overcome your determination to wait.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

You are a skilled urge surfer. When urges arise, you observe them with curiosity. You watch them rise, peak, and fall. You remain calm throughout.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

You use delay automatically. When urges strike, you wait. You do something else. The urge weakens and passes.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

You STOP instinctively. Stop. Take a breath. Observe. Proceed mindfully. This creates the gap in which you choose freedom.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

You move your body to break urges. You use cold water. You exercise. These physical responses reset your nervous system.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

You play the tape forward. You see past the momentary temptation to the consequences beyond. You choose the ending you want.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Each urge you master strengthens your freedom. You are building a life of mastery, one urge at a time.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

=== POST-HYPNOTIC SUGGESTIONS (2-3 minutes) ===

As you rest in this state of deep peace, your urge-mastery skills are cementing permanently.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

In the days and weeks ahead, when urges arise, you will respond with calm confidence. You know they will pass. You have tools. You are capable.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Each urge you successfully handle will increase your confidence and weaken the addiction. Time is on your side. Every victory builds on the last.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Remember: the scripture promises that with every temptation, there is a way of escape. These tools are that way. Use them, and you will always find the exit.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You are becoming a master of urges. Not just surviving them, but truly mastering them. This is your new identity.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== EMERGENCE (3-5 minutes) ===

And now, Austin, it is time to return to full waking consciousness. Everything you have learned stays with you. Your urge-mastery skills are installed and active.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

In a moment, I will count from one to ten. With each number, you'll become more alert, more awake, more refreshed... and your mastery will become more solid, more automatic.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One. Beginning to return. Urge-mastery skills coming with you.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Two. Becoming more aware of your body. Urge surfing installed.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Three. The room around you becoming more present. Delay technique ready.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Four. More alert now. STOP technique automatic.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Five. Halfway back. All tools available.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Six. Your eyes may flutter. You are a master of urges.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Seven. More and more alert. Confident and capable.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Eight. Almost there. Taking a deep, refreshing breath.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Nine. Ready to open your eyes and live with mastery.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Ten. Eyes open, fully awake, completely alert, and fully equipped.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Welcome back, Austin. You now have powerful tools for handling any urge that arises. Urge surfing. Delay. STOP. Physical movement. Play the tape forward. Substitution.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When urges come—and they will come—you know what to do. They are temporary waves. You are the surfer who rides them and remains standing. Master on, Austin. You have what it takes.
