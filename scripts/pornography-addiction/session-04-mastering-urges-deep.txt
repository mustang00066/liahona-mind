Duration: ~38 minutes
Voice: Male, British accent, calm and compassionate

[BEGIN SCRIPT]

Welcome back, Austin. Today you will master the art of handling urges. You will learn that urges are temporary, manageable, and ultimately powerless unless you give them power.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Take a deep breath in... and release.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Another breath, centering yourself... and release.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

One more breath... eyes closing, entering deep peace.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Relax completely. Head to toe. Allow the familiar wave of peace to wash through you.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Now, the staircase. Twenty steps down.

Twenty, nineteen, eighteen, seventeen, sixteen... going deeper.
Fifteen, fourteen, thirteen, twelve, eleven... mind quieting.
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six... completely relaxed.
Five, four, three, two, one... deep hypnosis achieved.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

an urge is a feeling. It is a sensation in your body and a thought in your mind. It is not a command. It is not an irresistible force. It is simply a wave that will pass.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This is the most important truth about urges: they always pass. Always. No urge lasts forever. If you wait it out, it will fade. This is a biological certainty.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Most urges peak within fifteen to twenty minutes, then decline. The intensity may rise, but it will also fall. Like a wave in the ocean, it has a beginning, a middle, and an end.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The technique called urge surfing teaches you to ride the wave. Instead of fighting the urge or giving in, you simply observe it. You watch it rise, notice its peak, and let it fall.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let us practice now. In your imagination, allow a mild urge to arise. Just a whisper of one. Enough to work with.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Notice where you feel it in your body. Perhaps in your chest, your stomach, or elsewhere. Notice the quality. Is it tight? Restless? Buzzing?

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Instead of reacting, simply observe. Say to yourself, I notice an urge arising. I am watching it. I am not acting on it.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Breathe slowly. Keep observing. The urge is not you. It is something happening in you. You are the observer, not the urge.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Notice if the urge changes. Perhaps it intensifies briefly. That is the wave rising. Keep watching. Keep breathing.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

And now notice it beginning to fade. The wave is cresting and falling. You did nothing but observe, and the urge is passing.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This is urge surfing. Not by fighting, not by giving in, but by watching urges pass.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The Savior was tempted in the wilderness for forty days. He did not give in. He did not panic. He simply let the temptations come and go while holding to His truth. You can do the same.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Now let us add the delay technique. When an urge strikes, commit to waiting ten minutes before doing anything. Tell yourself, I will wait ten minutes.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

During those ten minutes, do something else. Change your environment. Go to another room. Step outside. Call someone. Read scripture. Exercise.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

After ten minutes, the urge has usually weakened significantly. Delay is powerful.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Another tool is the STOP technique. S - Stop what you are doing. T - Take a breath. O - Observe the urge without acting. P - Proceed mindfully, choosing your response.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

STOP creates a gap between stimulus and response. In that gap, you have choice. And choice is freedom.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Physical movement also breaks urges. Stand up. Walk around. Do jumping jacks. Splash cold water on your face. Movement tells your brain something has changed.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Remember your strength anchor. Thumb and finger pressed together activates power. Use it when urges arise.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The Apostle Paul wrote, God will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape. These tools are that way.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Visualize yourself facing an urge in the future. You recognize it. You observe. You delay. You STOP. You move. You use your anchor. And the urge passes. Victory.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Each victory makes the next easier. The pathway of resistance strengthens. Urges become weaker over time. You are building mastery.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

As I count from one to ten, return to full awareness.

One... beginning to return.
Two... feeling capable.
Three... becoming alert.
Four... refreshed.
Five... halfway back.
Six... alertness increasing.
Seven... feeling wonderful.
Eight... almost there.
Nine... nearly awake.
Ten... eyes open, fully alert. You have the tools, Austin. Use them.
