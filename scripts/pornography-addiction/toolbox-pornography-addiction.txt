============================================================

2. HALT MONITORING CHECKLIST

Purpose: Catch vulnerability states before they stack up

HALT stands for: Hungry, Angry, Lonely, Tired
These states weaken your defenses and increase vulnerability.

Daily Check-In (do morning and evening):

□ HUNGRY: Have I eaten properly today?
  - When did I last eat?
  - Am I physically hungry now?
  - Do I need to eat something healthy?

□ ANGRY: Am I carrying frustration or resentment?
  - Is there unresolved conflict?
  - What am I upset about?
  - How can I process this healthily?

□ LONELY: Am I feeling isolated or disconnected?
  - When did I last have meaningful connection?
  - Am I withdrawing from people?
  - Who can I reach out to today?

□ TIRED: Am I getting adequate rest?
  - How many hours did I sleep?
  - Am I physically exhausted?
  - Do I need to rest rather than push through?

Intervention Protocol:
- If 1 HALT state is present: Address it within the hour
- If 2+ HALT states are present: Consider this a warning sign
- If 3+ HALT states are present: Implement emergency self-care immediately

Remember: Most relapses happen when multiple HALT states accumulate.
Don't let them stack.

============================================================

3. THE URGE SURFING TECHNIQUE

Purpose: Ride out urges without acting on them

The Science:
- Urges are like waves - they rise, peak, and fall
- Most urges peak within 15-20 minutes
- If you don't act on an urge, it will pass
- Each urge you survive weakens the addiction pathway

Step-by-Step Guide:

1. NOTICE the urge arising
   - Don't panic
   - Don't judge yourself
   - Just observe: "I notice an urge is here"

2. ANCHOR yourself
   - Press thumb and second finger together
   - Take a slow, deep breath
   - Feel your feet on the ground

3. OBSERVE with curiosity
   - Where do you feel the urge in your body?
   - What thoughts are accompanying it?
   - How intense is it on a scale of 1-10?

4. BREATHE through it
   - Slow, deep belly breaths
   - Count to 4 on the inhale
   - Count to 4 on the exhale

5. WATCH it change
   - Intensity rises... that's the wave building
   - Intensity peaks... hold on, this is the crest
   - Intensity falls... the wave is passing

6. CELEBRATE when it passes
   - You did it
   - The urge came and went without your help
   - Your freedom just got stronger

Practice tip: Track your urges for a week. Note intensity, duration,
and what triggered them. You'll discover your patterns.

============================================================

4. THE STOP TECHNIQUE

Purpose: Create a gap between trigger and response

S - STOP
   Pause whatever you are doing.
   Physically stop moving.
   Create a moment of stillness.

T - TAKE A BREATH
   One slow, deep breath.
   Inhale through your nose, belly expanding.
   Exhale through your mouth, slowly.
   This activates your parasympathetic nervous system.

O - OBSERVE
   What is happening right now?
   What triggered this moment?
   What am I feeling in my body?
   What thoughts are present?
   What am I tempted to do?

P - PROCEED MINDFULLY
   What is the wise choice right now?
   What will I be glad I did tomorrow morning?
   Choose deliberately, not reactively.

When to use STOP:
- When you feel triggered
- When you're about to enter a risky situation
- When you notice the beginning of ritual behavior
- When emotions are running high
- Any time you need to regain control

The gap between stimulus and response is where freedom lives.

============================================================

5. PLAY THE TAPE FORWARD EXERCISE

Purpose: Counter the lie that acting out will feel good

The Problem:
Your brain shows you only the first frame of acting out—the temporary
pleasure. It hides the rest of the film—the shame, regret, and emptiness.

The Solution:
When tempted, consciously play the ENTIRE tape forward.

Step 1: Acknowledge the immediate appeal
"Yes, there would be a few minutes of pleasure."

Step 2: Fast forward 5 minutes
"How will I feel immediately after?"
- Guilt and shame washing over me
- The pleasure already fading
- Wishing I hadn't done it

Step 3: Fast forward 1 hour
"How will I feel in an hour?"
- Avoiding eye contact with loved ones
- Feeling disconnected and numb
- Wondering why I did that again

Step 4: Fast forward to bedtime
"How will I feel going to sleep tonight?"
- Another day of sobriety broken
- Having to reset my count
- Heaviness in my heart

Step 5: Fast forward to tomorrow morning
"How will I feel waking up tomorrow?"
- Still carrying the shame
- Having to confess to accountability partner
- Starting over again

Now compare to NOT acting out:

Fast forward 5 minutes:
- The urge is fading
- Pride in my strength

Fast forward 1 hour:
- Peace and freedom
- Full presence with my life

Fast forward to bedtime:
- Clean conscience
- Another day of victory

Fast forward to tomorrow:
- Sobriety streak continues
- Freedom grows stronger

Which future do you want?

============================================================

6. THREE CIRCLES BOUNDARY WORKSHEET

Purpose: Define clear boundaries that protect your recovery

---

MIDDLE CIRCLE (YELLOW) - Warning behaviors that lead to relapse
Not relapses themselves, but they move me toward relapse.

Examples to consider:
□ Browsing social media late at night alone
□ Looking at "borderline" content
□ Letting my mind dwell on fantasies
□ Staying up past my technology curfew
□ Isolating when stressed
□ Skipping accountability check-ins
□ (Add your specific warning behaviors)

============================================================

7. HEALTHY COPING MENU

Purpose: Ready-to-use alternatives when you need to cope

When stress, boredom, loneliness, or difficult emotions arise, choose
from this menu instead of old patterns.

EMOTIONAL COPING (process the feeling)
□ Feel the feeling - name it, locate it in your body, let it pass
□ Journal - write what you're feeling without editing
□ Pray - pour out your heart to Heavenly Father
□ Talk to someone - call a friend or family member
□ Cry if needed - tears release stress hormones

PHYSICAL COPING (move your body)
□ Exercise - walk, run, lift weights, do pushups
□ Cold water - splash face or take a cold shower
□ Deep breathing - box breathing (4-4-4-4) for 2 minutes
□ Progressive relaxation - tense and release each muscle group
□ Change locations - physically move to a different room/place

SOCIAL COPING (connect with others)
□ Call your accountability partner
□ Text a friend
□ Visit someone in person
□ Perform an act of service
□ Go to a public place

SPIRITUAL COPING (draw on divine resources)
□ Read scriptures - even just 5 minutes
□ Listen to hymns or spiritual music
□ Attend the temple (or virtual tour if unavailable)
□ Review patriarchal blessing
□ Listen to General Conference talk

COGNITIVE COPING (change your thinking)
□ Question the thought - "Is this thought true?"
□ Reframe - "This is making me stronger"
□ Distract - engage in absorbing activity
□ Delay - "I will wait 10 minutes before deciding"
□ Remember your why - look at photos of loved ones

POST THIS LIST somewhere visible. When triggered, pick 2-3 items
and do them immediately.

============================================================

8. ACCOUNTABILITY CHECK-IN TEMPLATES

Purpose: Structure for honest, regular accountability

DAILY TEXT CHECK-IN (takes 30 seconds)
Send this to your accountability partner each day:

"Daily check:
□ Clean today: Yes/No
□ HALT status: [note any present]
□ Tomorrow's risk level: Low/Medium/High
□ Need to talk: Yes/No"

---

WEEKLY CALL CHECK-IN (15-30 minutes)
Use these questions:

1. How are you really doing this week? (Be honest)
2. Did you have any struggles? Any close calls?
3. What were your triggers this week?
4. How did you handle them?
5. What HALT states were present this week?
6. How is your spiritual life?
7. What do you need support with?
8. What victories can you celebrate?
9. What does next week look like? Any high-risk situations?
10. What is one thing you will do differently?

---

WHEN YOU'RE STRUGGLING (crisis text)
Send immediately:

"I am struggling right now. Can you [call me / pray for me /
check on me in 30 minutes]?"

You don't need to explain. Just reach out.

---

WHEN YOU'VE SLIPPED (confession template)
Send within 24 hours:

"I need to tell you that I [describe what happened] on [when].
I've [done/not done] the following since: [self-care steps]
I believe it was triggered by: [what led to it]
I need help with: [specific support]"

Quick confession prevents shame from compounding.

============================================================

9. RELAPSE PREVENTION STAGES GUIDE

Purpose: Recognize where you are and intervene early

STAGE 1: EMOTIONAL RELAPSE
You're not thinking about acting out, but setting yourself up.

Signs:
□ Isolating from people
□ Not going to meetings or check-ins
□ Bottling up emotions
□ Poor self-care (sleep, food, exercise)
□ Neglecting spiritual practices
□ Focusing on others' problems instead of yours

Intervention:
→ Reach out to someone today
→ Share how you're really feeling
→ Implement basic self-care immediately
→ Attend a support meeting
→ This is easy to correct if caught early

---

STAGE 2: MENTAL RELAPSE
Part of you wants to act out. You're at war with yourself.

Signs:
□ Thinking about acting out
□ Glamorizing past use (remembering pleasure, forgetting pain)
□ Minimizing consequences ("It's not that bad")
□ Bargaining ("Just this once")
□ Lying to yourself or others
□ Planning a relapse

Intervention:
→ Tell your accountability partner NOW (not later)
→ Remove yourself from risky situations
→ Play the tape forward repeatedly
→ Use all your tools: STOP, urge surfing, anchor
→ Increase meeting attendance
→ This requires urgent action

---

STAGE 3: PHYSICAL RELAPSE
Acting out has begun.

Intervention:
→ STOP as soon as you can - every moment matters
→ A slip is not permission to binge
→ Contact accountability partner immediately
→ Do not shame spiral - shame fuels more acting out
→ Get back on track without delay
→ Learn from it: what stage did you miss?

Remember: The righteous falls seven times and rises again.
Rising is what matters.
