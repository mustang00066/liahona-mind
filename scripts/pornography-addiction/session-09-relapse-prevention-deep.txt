=== PRE-TALK / SETTLING (2-3 minutes) ===

Welcome, Austin. You have come so far in your recovery. Today we focus on something that will protect everything you have built: relapse prevention.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Recovery is not a single event—it is a lifelong journey. Understanding how relapses happen allows you to prevent them. Recognizing early warning signs means you can intervene before crisis arrives.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Today you will learn the three stages of relapse, install early warning systems in your subconscious, and create a protection plan that will safeguard your freedom for years to come.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This session is not about fear. It is about wisdom. The scripture says the prudent man sees danger and takes refuge. Today you become prudent. Today you fortify your recovery.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Find a comfortable position. Allow your body to settle. This session will install protection systems that operate automatically. Let us begin.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== INDUCTION - Eye Fatigue with Diaphragmatic Breathing (10-12 minutes) ===

Begin by finding a spot on the ceiling or wall, slightly above your natural line of sight. A spot that requires you to look upward without straining your neck.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Focus on that spot. Keep your eyes fixed there as you begin to breathe deeply. Diaphragmatic breathing—belly expanding as you breathe in, sinking as you breathe out.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Breathe in through your nose... belly rising gently... hold for a moment... and release through your mouth. With this exhale, your protection systems strengthen.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Continue gazing at that spot. Notice how your eyes begin to feel. A slight strain. A heaviness developing. This is natural and welcome. With each breath, this heaviness increases.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Another breath now... deeper than before... belly expanding... hold... and release. Your recovery is being fortified.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Keep your eyes on that spot. They are growing heavier. The muscles around your eyes are tiring. Some of you may notice a watering of the eyes. Others feel a pulling sensation. Both are signs that hypnosis is developing.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Breathe in once more... letting the breath fill your entire chest cavity... hold... and as you exhale, notice your eyes wanting to close. When the desire becomes strong enough, allow them to close naturally.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

If your eyes have not yet closed, take another breath and let them close with the exhale. There is no rush. Your eyes will close when they are ready.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Eyes now closed... feel the relief. The muscles that were straining are now resting. This is the first protection—the first barrier in place. And it feels wonderful.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Now that your eyes are closed, bring your attention to your breathing. Allow each breath to deepen the relaxation flowing through your body.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

With your next breath, focus on your scalp. Feel it softening, relaxing. Any tension held there simply melting away. Warmth spreading across the top of your head.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

This warmth flows down to your forehead. Feel the muscles of your forehead smoothing out. All worry lines dissolving. Your forehead becoming cool, calm, completely relaxed.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Down to your eyes now—those tired muscles resting deeply. Your eyelids becoming wonderfully heavy. As though tiny weights are gently pressing them down. So heavy that you have no desire to open them.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The relaxation spreads to your cheeks and jaw. Your jaw becoming slack. Your teeth parting slightly. All the tension that accumulates in your jaw throughout the day—released now. Melting away like ice in warm water.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Down into your neck. Feel each vertebra of your neck relaxing. The muscles on the sides and back of your neck becoming loose like warm rubber. Your head feeling balanced and light.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The wave of relaxation flows into your shoulders. Shoulders are where we carry so much of life's burden. Feel yours dropping now. Releasing their load. Becoming soft and heavy.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Down through your arms. The relaxation flowing like warm honey through your upper arms... your elbows... your forearms. Into your wrists and hands. Each finger becoming loose and heavy.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Your chest now. Feel your breathing becoming even slower, even deeper. Your heart beating calmly, steadily. A sense of peace filling your entire chest cavity.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The warmth spreads through your stomach. Any knots or butterflies dissolving completely. Your stomach becoming soft and relaxed. All digestive tension released.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Into your lower back—that area that works so hard. Feel it softening. The muscles along your spine releasing their grip. Your entire back sinking into whatever supports you.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Through your hips now, releasing any tightness held there. Down into your thighs. Your large leg muscles becoming completely limp, loose, and heavy. Like lead weights.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Past your knees, into your calves. These muscles that carry you through each day—resting now. Completely at peace.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Into your ankles, your feet, your toes. Every muscle, every joint, every cell of your body now bathed in deep relaxation.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

You are deeply relaxed, Austin. Your body is at peace. Your mind is calm and receptive. With each breath, you go deeper. The better you feel, the deeper you go. The deeper you go, the stronger your protection becomes.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== DEEPENING - 20-Step Staircase (8-10 minutes) ===

In your mind's eye, you find yourself at the top of a beautiful staircase. This staircase has twenty steps, and it leads down to a control room—a place where your early warning systems are installed and your protection protocols are programmed.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The banister is smooth beneath your hand. The steps are solid and safe. With each step you descend, you will go twice as deep into hypnosis, and your protection systems will become more fully installed.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Step twenty. Taking the first step down. Feeling relaxation deepen. Protection beginning to form.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step nineteen. Going deeper. Warning systems activating.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step eighteen. Deeper still. Recovery being fortified.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step seventeen. Every step takes you deeper. Every step strengthens your protection.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step sixteen. Mind quieting. Defense systems coming online.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step fifteen. Halfway there. So deep already. So protected.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step fourteen. Your subconscious is learning to recognize danger early.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step thirteen. Deeper than before. Profoundly protected.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step twelve. Your subconscious is wide open, ready for safety programming.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step eleven. So peaceful. So vigilant.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step ten. Entering the deepest levels now. The control room is near.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step nine. Every protection protocol will be installed powerfully.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step eight. Going deeper still.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step seven. Profound safety systems developing.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step six. Almost there, Austin.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step five. So deep now. Fully fortified.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step four. Deeper than you have ever been.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step three. The control room is just ahead.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step two. One more step.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step one. You step off the staircase into the control room. You are in the deepest state of hypnosis. Here, your early warning systems are installed and your protection protocols are programmed. Everything you hear will be absorbed completely by your subconscious mind.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== THERAPEUTIC CONTENT (15-18 minutes) ===

--- Relapse is a Process ---

Austin, the most important thing to understand about relapse: it is a process, not an event. Long before the actual acting out, warning signs appear. There are stages, and by recognizing early stages, you can intervene before it is too late.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Think of relapse like a cliff edge. You do not suddenly find yourself falling. You walk toward the cliff step by step. If you recognize you are heading toward the edge early enough, you can simply change direction.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The three stages of relapse are: emotional relapse, mental relapse, and physical relapse. Understanding each stage allows you to catch yourself early.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Stage One: Emotional Relapse ---

Emotional relapse is the first stage. You are not thinking about acting out—not consciously. But your emotions and behaviors are setting you up for future failure.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Signs of emotional relapse include isolation—withdrawing from people, avoiding accountability check-ins, keeping to yourself more than usual.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Bottling up emotions—not talking about how you feel, stuffing down anger or sadness or frustration.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Poor self-care—neglecting sleep, skipping meals, abandoning exercise, not taking care of your body.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Neglecting spiritual practices—skipping prayers, not reading scriptures, avoiding church.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Focusing on others' problems instead of your own—a subtle way of avoiding self-reflection.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

In emotional relapse, you are not thinking about pornography or masturbation. But you are creating the conditions where temptation will be strong. You are weakening your defenses without realizing it.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The intervention at this stage is simple: reach out, practice self-care, address emotions, maintain spiritual practices. These simple actions prevent progression to the next stage.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Stage Two: Mental Relapse ---

Mental relapse is the second stage. Part of you wants to act out, and part of you does not. You are at war with yourself.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Signs of mental relapse include thinking about acting out—images or memories arising, fantasizing, dwelling on past experiences.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Glamorizing past use—remembering the pleasure while forgetting the pain, selective memory that makes the addiction look appealing.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Minimizing consequences—telling yourself it is not that bad, it will not affect anyone, just this once would be fine.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Bargaining—making deals with yourself: "If I do this, then I will be extra good afterward." Or: "I deserve this after how hard things have been."

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Lying—small deceptions that create space for larger ones. Not being fully honest with accountability partners.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Planning relapse—knowing where, when, and how. Creating opportunity. Putting yourself in situations where acting out becomes possible.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

In mental relapse, the window for intervention is closing. You must escalate your response. Tell your accountability partner immediately. Increase your support activities. Remove yourself from risky situations. Play the tape forward—remember how you will feel after acting out.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Stage Three: Physical Relapse ---

Physical relapse is the final stage—the actual acting out. If it reaches this point, damage control is the priority.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Stop as soon as you can. A single slip is not permission to binge. Every moment you can stop is a victory.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Reach out immediately afterward. Do not let hours or days pass. Quick confession prevents shame from compounding. Contact your accountability partner. Confess. Process.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Get back on track without delay. A relapse does not erase your progress. The neural pathways you have been building are still there. Every day of recovery before the relapse still counts.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Learn from the relapse. What led to it? What stage did you miss? What will you do differently next time? Failure is only wasted if no lesson is learned.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Installing Early Warning Systems ---

Now, let us install early warning systems in your subconscious mind. These are automatic alerts that will trigger when you enter the early stages of relapse.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When you begin isolating, an internal alert will sound. Something in you will recognize: I am withdrawing. This is a warning sign. I need to reconnect.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When you neglect self-care, you will notice. Something will say: I am not taking care of myself. This makes me vulnerable. I need to course correct.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When emotions start bottling up, an alarm will trigger. You will recognize: I am stuffing my feelings. This is dangerous. I need to process.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When thoughts of acting out arise, you will immediately recognize the mental relapse stage. You will think: I am in mental relapse. I need to intervene now. Not tomorrow. Now.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

These warning systems will be gentle but clear. Not panicked, but attentive. Like a trustworthy friend who cares about your wellbeing.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- The HALT Framework Revisited ---

Remember HALT from our first session. Hungry, Angry, Lonely, Tired. These are vulnerability states that increase risk of relapse.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Install HALT monitoring in your subconscious. When you are Hungry, you will notice and address it. When you are Angry, you will recognize the vulnerability. When you are Lonely, you will reach out. When you are Tired, you will rest.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

These are simple interventions, but they prevent many relapses. Most acting out happens when multiple HALT states accumulate. Do not let them stack.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Your Relapse Prevention Plan ---

Create a relapse prevention plan. Know in advance what you will do at each stage. When crisis comes, you will not have to think—you will just execute.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

At emotional relapse, you will call your accountability partner and schedule an extra check-in. You will implement immediate self-care—sleep, exercise, nutrition. You will reach out to a friend.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

At mental relapse, you will tell someone immediately. You will remove yourself from any risky situation. You will play the tape forward repeatedly. You will use your anchor and access all your urge-mastery tools.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

At physical relapse, you will stop as soon as possible. You will confess within hours, not days. You will not shame spiral. You will get back up immediately.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This plan is now programmed into your subconscious. When you recognize a stage, the appropriate response will arise automatically.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- High-Risk Situations ---

Certain situations carry higher risk. Know your personal high-risk times and plan for them.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Travel often creates vulnerability. Away from home, from routine, from accountability. Plan for trips by increasing check-ins and setting extra boundaries.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Stress of any kind—work pressure, relationship conflict, financial worry—increases vulnerability. When stress rises, increase your recovery activities.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Celebration can be dangerous—a sense of "I deserve this" or "I have been doing so well." Stay vigilant even when things are good.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Boredom is a common trigger. Have a plan for unstructured time. Know what you will do when idle hours arise.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Late night hours often carry higher risk. Set technology curfews. Create structure around evening time.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Know your personal patterns. What situations have preceded past relapses? Those situations require extra vigilance.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Rising After a Fall ---

If you do relapse, know this: it is not the end. A slip does not erase your progress. The righteous man falls seven times and rises again. Rising is what matters.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Do not let shame after a relapse drive you into a binge. The adversary wants to convince you that since you already fell, you might as well continue. This is a lie. Stop. Get up. Now.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Do not replay the relapse mentally. Replaying only strengthens the neural pathways you are trying to weaken. Acknowledge what happened, learn from it, and move forward.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Every moment is a new opportunity to choose differently. Your next choice matters more than your last one.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Anchor Reinforcement ---

Press your thumb and second finger together now.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

This anchor carries your relapse prevention programming. Early warning systems. The HALT framework. Your prevention plan. The commitment to rise if you fall.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Feel all of this protection flowing into this anchor. You are not defenseless. You have systems in place. Your recovery is fortified.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Whenever you sense danger, use this anchor and remember: I know the warning signs. I have a plan. I will intervene early.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Release the anchor now. The protection is installed.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Future Pacing: Sustainable Recovery ---

See yourself in the future. Years from now, still free. The vigilance has become natural, automatic. You do not white-knuckle resist every day. You simply live as someone who is free.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your early warning systems have become second nature. You notice emotional relapse signs automatically and course correct without drama. You recognize HALT states and address them immediately.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Occasional temptations arise—they always will—but they are weak whispers, easily dismissed. They have no power because you have become someone different.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Freedom is your normal state. You cannot imagine going back. The life you live now is too good to trade for the prison you escaped.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This future is forming now. Every day of recovery builds it. Every temptation you survive strengthens it. You are creating a life of sustainable freedom.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Scriptural Foundation ---

The Savior taught, "Watch and pray, lest ye enter into temptation." This watching is what relapse prevention is about. Vigilance without anxiety. Awareness without obsession.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The Lord promised that He will not suffer you to be tempted above that which you are able, but will with the temptation also make a way to escape. There is always a way of escape. Your relapse prevention plan is that way.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

He watches over you. He strengthens you. He provides resources for your recovery. You are not alone in this vigilance.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== POST-HYPNOTIC SUGGESTIONS (2-3 minutes) ===

Your subconscious now holds complete relapse prevention programming. Early warning systems are active. Your protection plan is installed.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You will automatically recognize emotional relapse signs—isolation, poor self-care, bottled emotions. When they appear, you will respond immediately.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You will automatically recognize mental relapse signs—glamorizing, minimizing, planning. When they appear, you will escalate your response.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

HALT monitoring runs continuously. You will notice and address Hungry, Angry, Lonely, and Tired states before they accumulate.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

If you ever fall, you will stop quickly, confess quickly, and rise quickly. One slip will never become a pattern.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your recovery is protected. Your freedom is fortified. You are equipped to maintain sobriety for the rest of your life.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== EMERGENCE (3-5 minutes) ===

It is time to return to full awareness, carrying your protection programming with you.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

In a moment, I will count from one to ten. With each number, you will become more alert, more awake, while all your protection systems remain fully active.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One. Beginning the journey back. Protection systems installed.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Welcome back, Austin. Your recovery is safeguarded. You know the warning signs. You have a plan. You will intervene early and rise if you ever fall.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Stay vigilant, and stay free. The Lord watches with you. His strength upholds you. You are equipped for lasting freedom.
