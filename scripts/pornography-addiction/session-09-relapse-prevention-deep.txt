[BEGIN SCRIPT]

Welcome, Austin. Today we focus on relapse prevention. You will learn to recognize warning signs early, respond effectively, and maintain your freedom for the long term. Find a comfortable position and prepare for deep, transformative work.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Begin by taking a slow, deep breath in through your nose... hold it for a moment... and release slowly through your mouth, letting go of any tension in your body.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Take another deep breath, even deeper this time... filling your lungs completely... hold... and release, feeling your shoulders drop and relax.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

One more breath... breathing in peace and calm... hold... and as you exhale, allow your eyes to close and your body to begin its descent into deep relaxation.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Now, bring your attention to the top of your head. Imagine a warm, golden light beginning to glow there. This light is healing, peaceful, deeply relaxing. Feel it warming your scalp, releasing any tension held there.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let this golden light slowly spread down across your forehead. Feel the muscles of your forehead smoothing out, all worry lines dissolving. The light brings peace wherever it touches.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The light flows down around your eyes. The tiny muscles around your eyes relax completely. Your eyelids become heavy and comfortable. There is no need to open them.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Down across your cheeks now, the warmth spreading. Into your jaw, that place where so many of us hold tension. Let your jaw go slack. Let your teeth part slightly. Complete release.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The golden light flows down your neck, releasing any stiffness. Down into your shoulders. Your shoulders carry so much. Let them drop now. Let them release completely. Feel the weight lifting.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Down through your arms, this healing warmth. Through your upper arms, your elbows, your forearms. Into your hands and fingers. Your hands become heavy, warm, completely relaxed.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The light spreads through your chest now. Feel your breathing become even deeper, even more relaxed. Your heart beats calmly, steadily. Peace fills your chest.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Down into your stomach, releasing any knots of tension. Your stomach softens, relaxes. The warmth spreads through your lower back, an area that often holds stress. Release it now.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Through your hips, down into your thighs. Your large leg muscles letting go completely. Down through your knees, your calves, your ankles. Into your feet and toes. Every part of you is now deeply relaxed.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Your entire body is bathed in this golden, healing light. You are safe. You are at peace. You are ready to go deeper.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Now, imagine yourself standing at the top of a beautiful staircase. This staircase has twenty steps, leading down to a place of profound peace and receptivity. With each step you descend, you will go twice as deep as before.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step twenty. Beginning your descent. Feeling relaxation deepen.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Step nineteen. Going deeper. The world above fading away.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Step eighteen. Deeper still. Nothing matters but this moment.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Step seventeen. Your body so heavy, so relaxed.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Step sixteen. Mind quieting. Peace increasing.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Step fifteen. Halfway there. Going deeper with each step.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Step fourteen. Releasing everything. Trusting completely.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Step thirteen. Deeper than before. Profoundly relaxed.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Step twelve. Your subconscious mind opening wide.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Step eleven. So peaceful. So receptive.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Step ten. Entering the deepest levels now.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Step nine. Every suggestion will be received powerfully.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Step eight. Going deeper still.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Step seven. Profound hypnotic state developing.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Step six. Almost there, Austin.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Step five. So deep now.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Step four. Deeper than you've ever been.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Step three. The deepest peace.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Step two. One more step.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Step one. You have arrived. You are now in the deepest, most receptive state of hypnosis. Everything you hear will be absorbed completely by your subconscious mind.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

in this profound state, let us address relapse prevention. Recovery is not a single event but a lifelong journey. Understanding how relapses happen allows you to prevent them.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Relapse is a process, not an event. Long before the actual acting out, warning signs appear. There is emotional relapse, then mental relapse, then physical relapse. By recognizing early stages, you can intervene before it's too late.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Emotional relapse is the first stage. You are not thinking about acting out, but your emotions and behaviors are setting you up. Signs include isolation, not going to meetings or keeping commitments, bottling up emotions, poor self-care, and focusing on others' problems instead of your own.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When you notice these signs, take action immediately. Reach out to someone. Address the emotions you are avoiding. Practice self-care. These simple interventions prevent progression to the next stage.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Mental relapse is the second stage. Part of you wants to act out, and part of you doesn't. You are at war with yourself. Signs include thinking about acting out, glamorizing past use, minimizing consequences, bargaining, lying, and planning a relapse.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

If you find yourself in mental relapse, escalate your response. Tell your accountability partner immediately. Increase your meeting attendance. Remove yourself from risky situations. Play the tape forward—remember how you will feel after acting out.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Physical relapse is the final stage—the actual acting out. If it reaches this point, limit the damage. Stop as soon as you can. Do not binge. Reach out immediately afterward. Get back on track without delay.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The Savior taught that we should watch and pray, lest we enter into temptation. This watching is what relapse prevention is about. Vigilance without anxiety. Awareness without obsession.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let us now install early warning systems in your subconscious mind. When you begin isolating, an internal alert will sound. When you neglect self-care, you will notice. When thoughts of acting out arise, you will recognize the mental relapse stage immediately.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

These warnings will be gentle but clear. Not panicked, but attentive. You will simply know: I am in early stage relapse. I need to take action now.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Create a relapse prevention plan. Know who you will call. Know what meetings you will attend. Know what actions you will take at each stage. Having a plan means you don't have to think when crisis comes—you just execute.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your plan might include: At emotional relapse, I will call my sponsor and attend an extra meeting. At mental relapse, I will tell my accountability partner and implement emergency self-care. These predetermined responses protect you.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Remember HALT. Hungry, Angry, Lonely, Tired. These states increase vulnerability. Monitor them daily. Address them proactively. Don't let them accumulate.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

High-risk situations require extra vigilance. Travel, stress, celebration, conflict, boredom—know your personal high-risk times and plan for them. Extra accountability, extra check-ins, extra boundaries.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

If you do relapse, it is not the end. A slip does not erase your progress. Get back up immediately. The scripture says the righteous man falls seven times and rises again. Rising is what matters.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Do not let shame after a relapse drive you into a binge. One slip is not permission to continue. Stop, confess, learn, and recommit. Every moment is a new opportunity to choose differently.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your recovery is being protected now. The warning systems are installed. The plan is in place. You are equipped to maintain your freedom for the rest of your life.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

See yourself years from now, still free. The vigilance has become natural, automatic. You live in sustainable recovery, not white-knuckled resistance. Freedom is your normal state.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let all of this settle deep into your subconscious. The early warning systems. The relapse prevention plan. The commitment to rise if you fall. Your recovery is secure.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Now, it is time to return to full waking consciousness. As I count from one to ten, you will gradually become more alert, bringing all of this wisdom with you.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

One... beginning the journey back.
Two... feeling energy returning to your body.
Three... becoming aware of your surroundings.
Four... your mind clearing, feeling refreshed.
Five... halfway back now.
Six... moving toward full alertness.
Seven... almost there, feeling good.
Eight... energy and clarity increasing.
Nine... nearly fully awake.
Ten... eyes open, fully alert, feeling protected and prepared. Your recovery is safeguarded, Austin. Stay vigilant, and stay free.
