Duration: ~28 minutes
Voice: Male, British accent, calm and compassionate

[BEGIN SCRIPT]

Welcome back, Austin. Today we rewire your brain. Old pathways weaken. New pathways of freedom strengthen.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Take a deep breath in... and release.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Another breath, deeper... your brain ready to change.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One more breath... eyes closing, entering neuroplasticity.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let relaxation flow through you. Head to toe. Complete peace.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Descend now. Ten to one. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Deep hypnosis.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Austin, your brain has been conditioned by pornography and masturbation. Each time you viewed or acted out, you strengthened neural pathways. These now fire automatically.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

But the brain is plastic. Neurons that fire together, wire together. Neurons that stop firing together, unwire. This is your path to freedom.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Each day you abstain, old pathways weaken. Each healthy choice strengthens new pathways. Your brain is literally rewiring itself.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The hijacked dopamine system is recalibrating. Withdrawal passes. Sensitivity returns. Real life becomes rewarding again.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

See old pathways—dark, overgrown paths to pornography and masturbation. Watch them fading, disappearing with disuse.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Now see new pathways—bright, clear roads to healthy pleasures. Connection. Accomplishment. Activity. Peace. These grow stronger daily.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The scripture speaks of putting off the natural man. Your addicted patterns are the natural man. Through the Atonement, you become new.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Healthy habits accelerate rewiring. Exercise. Sleep. Nutrition. Social connection satisfies what addiction counterfeited.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When urges arise, they are just old pathways firing. Memories, not commands. Observe without obeying. Each passed urge weakens the pathway.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

See yourself a year from now. Brain healed. Old pathways gone. Free from pornography and compulsive masturbation. Truly free.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One... beginning to return.
Two... brain rewiring.
Three... becoming alert.
Four... refreshed.
Five... eyes open, fully alert. Your brain is changing, Austin. Keep healing.
