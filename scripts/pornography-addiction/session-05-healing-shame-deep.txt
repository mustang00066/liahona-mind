=== PRE-TALK / SETTLING (2-3 minutes) ===

Welcome, Austin. Find a comfortable position now and allow yourself to settle into stillness. This session addresses something at the very heart of your struggle: shame. This may be the most important session yet.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You have been building important tools—you understand addiction, you have boundaries, you know how your brain is healing, and you can master urges. But beneath all of this, for many who struggle with pornography and masturbation, there lies a deeper wound: shame.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Shame is different from guilt. Guilt says, "I did something bad." Shame says, "I am bad." Guilt can motivate positive change. Shame paralyzes and isolates. Today we heal the shame, because shame keeps us trapped and healing shame sets us free.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This session requires tenderness and courage. You may feel some emotion arise. That is okay. Whatever you feel is welcome here. Whatever you have done is forgivable. You are safe, and you are loved.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let us begin this healing work.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== INDUCTION - Eye Fatigue and Diaphragmatic Breathing (10-12 minutes) ===

Before we close your eyes, find a spot above your natural line of sight. Perhaps on the ceiling... or high on the wall ahead of you. Focus your eyes on that spot now.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Notice how this upward gaze begins to tire your eye muscles. This eye fatigue prepares you for deep emotional healing. As your eyes grow heavier, your heart opens to receive compassion.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

As you hold this gaze, begin your diaphragmatic breathing. Belly breathing... when you breathe in, your belly expands like a balloon filling with air. When you breathe out, your belly button sinks toward your spine.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Breathe in deeply through your nose... let your belly rise... hold for a moment... and release slowly through your mouth. With each exhale, shame begins to release.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

This breathing stimulates your vagus nerve, activating your body's natural healing response. You are entering a state where deep emotional wounds can be tended.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Take another deep belly breath. Your eyes still focused upward... heavier now... more tired. Breathe in... belly expanding... hold... and release. Love is entering where shame has been.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

Your eyelids are growing so heavy. Like weights are attached to them. Allow this heaviness to deepen with each breath.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

One more breath. And as you exhale this time, allow your eyes to close. Let them fall shut with relief. Your eyes are closed now, and you are safe in this place of healing.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Good. Now imagine your neck becoming like a bundle of loose rubber bands. All tension dissolving. Your head floating gently... weightless... like a helium balloon.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Allow your jaws to sag. Your mouth opening slightly. Your tongue resting loosely on the floor of your mouth. The forehead smoothing out completely.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let your shoulders sag completely. All the weight you carry there... all the shame you carry... dropping away. Shoulders sinking... sinking... as low as they can possibly go.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

Your arms becoming limp, loose, and heavy. So limp, so loose, so heavy. From shoulders to fingertips, complete relaxation.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

Your hands, Austin. Feel them completely at rest. At peace.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Now your legs and feet. Allow them to become limp, loose, and heavy. So limp, so loose, so heavy.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

The better you feel, the deeper you go. The deeper you go, the more healing occurs.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

It feels so good to just relax. It feels so good to just breathe. It feels so good to be safe and held and loved.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Your eyelids now... so relaxed they've become wonderfully heavy. As though stuck together with gentle glue. They are at peace.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

From head to toe, you are deeply relaxed. Your body is at peace. Your heart is ready for healing. Let us go deeper.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== DEEPENING (8-10 minutes) ===

Now, imagine yourself at the top of a staircase. This staircase leads down to a sanctuary of healing—a sacred place where shame dissolves and you receive the truth about who you are.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

There are twenty steps. With each step, you go deeper into this healing space. By the bottom, you will be ready to release shame and receive love.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step twenty. You place your foot on the first step. Beginning to descend. Defenses softening.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Nineteen. Another step down. Deeper relaxation. Your heart opening.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Eighteen. Deeper now. Every part of you welcoming healing.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Seventeen. Going deeper. The sanctuary coming into view.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Sixteen. Shame beginning to loosen its grip.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Fifteen. Past the surface. Into deep healing territory.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Fourteen. Deeper and deeper. Love is flowing in.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Thirteen. So relaxed. So safe. So held.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Twelve. The better you feel, the more healing occurs.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Eleven. Halfway there. Halfway to complete healing.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Ten. Deeper. More open. More receptive.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Nine. Each step releasing more shame.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Eight. Deeper. Truth replacing lies.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Seven. Almost there. The sanctuary clearly visible now.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Six. Profound depth. Profound safety.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Five. So deep now. Ready for deep healing.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Four. The sanctuary doors opening.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Three. The final steps.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Two. One more step.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

One. You step into the sanctuary of healing—a sacred space where shame dissolves and you know your true worth.

[PAUSE 8 SECONDS]

You are now in a state of deep hypnosis where profound emotional healing occurs. Your conscious mind can relax while your deepest wounds are tended with infinite compassion.

[PAUSE 8 SECONDS]

=== THERAPEUTIC CONTENT (15-18 minutes) ===

--- Understanding Shame vs. Guilt ---

Austin, let us begin by understanding exactly what we are healing.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Guilt says, "I did something bad." It is a response to behavior. Guilt can be healthy—it signals that we have violated our values and motivates us to change.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Shame is different. Shame says, "I am bad." It attacks identity, not just behavior. Shame does not motivate change—it paralyzes. Shame does not heal—it isolates. Shame is a lie that has been whispered to your soul.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Many who struggle with pornography and masturbation carry deep shame. They feel fundamentally flawed, uniquely broken, unworthy of love. This shame often existed before the addiction began, and the addiction made it worse.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

--- The Shame Cycle ---

Here is the tragic irony you must understand: shame fuels addiction.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When we feel worthless, we seek escape. When we feel unlovable, we seek comfort. Pornography and masturbation offer temporary numbing—a brief escape from the pain of shame.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

But then what happens? After acting out, shame increases. We feel worse about ourselves than before. The cycle goes: shame → pain → seeking relief → acting out → more shame.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

This is why willpower alone often fails. You are not just fighting behavior—you are fighting a shame engine that drives the behavior. To break the cycle, we must heal the shame.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

--- Separating Behavior from Identity ---

The first step in healing shame is separating your behavior from your identity.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

You have done things you regret. This is true. You have viewed pornography. You have masturbated. You have broken promises to yourself and possibly to others. These are facts.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

But you are not those things. Your behavior does not define you. What you have done is not who you are.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Say this in your mind now: "I have done things I regret. But I am not defined by what I have done. My behavior does not determine my worth."

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

A person who struggles with addiction is still a person—still a child of God, still bearing divine image, still infinitely valuable. The struggle does not erase the value. The behavior does not erase the identity.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

--- Your Divine Worth ---

Austin, your worth was established before you were born. You are a son of God. You carry divine heritage. This identity cannot be changed by your mistakes.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

No amount of sin can make you worthless. No amount of failure can erase your divine origin. Your worth is not earned by good behavior, and it cannot be lost by bad behavior. It is intrinsic. It is permanent. It is eternal.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The Savior did not come for the righteous. He came for sinners. For the broken, the struggling, the ashamed. He came for you, Austin. His love has never wavered. Not once. Not ever.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

In your imagination now, allow yourself to see yourself as God sees you. Not as your shame tells you. But as He actually sees you.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

He sees His child. He sees the goodness in your heart that persists despite your struggles. He sees your desire to change, your efforts, your prayers, your tears. He sees someone infinitely precious, someone worth saving.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

--- Receiving Divine Love ---

Now, feel His love for you. Allow yourself to receive it.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This love is not earned. It does not depend on your performance. It is unconditional, infinite, eternal. It simply is, because of who He is and because of who you are.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let that love wash over you like a warm wave. Feel it entering every part of you—every place where shame has lived, every wound that shame has caused.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let it soak into the places that feel dark and broken. Let it dissolve the lies. Let it speak the truth: You are loved. You are worthy. You are not alone.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

--- The Atonement Covers Shame ---

The Savior's Atonement covers not only our sins but our pains, our sorrows, and our shame.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The scripture says He took upon Himself our infirmities, that He might know how to succor His people according to their infirmities. He felt what you feel. He knows your shame. He understands it from the inside.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

He did this not to condemn you, but to understand you. Not to judge you, but to heal you. He descended below all things so that He might know how to lift you.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

This means there is no shame you carry that He has not already carried. There is no darkness in you that He has not already walked through. He is qualified to heal you because He has felt what you feel.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

--- Healing a Shameful Memory ---

Now, Austin, allow your mind to present a memory where you felt overwhelming shame. Just one memory. Let it surface gently. You are safe.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

Acknowledge this memory. Notice where you feel the shame in your body—perhaps your chest, your stomach, your face. Just notice, without judgment.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Now imagine the Savior entering that memory. He is there beside you—not distant, not disgusted, but close and compassionate.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

He looks at you with eyes of perfect understanding. He knows exactly what happened. He knows why. And His expression is not contempt—it is love. Tender, fierce, unchanging love.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Hear Him speak to you now: "I know. I understand. And I love you still. Nothing you have done can separate you from my love. Nothing you could ever do. Come, follow me into freedom."

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let His presence in that memory change it. Feel the shame beginning to lift. Feel the darkness becoming light. You are not alone in that memory anymore. He is there, and He transforms everything He touches.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

--- Breaking Shame Through Connection ---

Shame thrives in secrecy and isolation. It whispers, "Don't tell anyone. They won't understand. They'll reject you." But this is a lie.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The scripture says, "Confess your faults one to another, that ye may be healed." There is healing power in honest connection. When we bring struggles into the light, shame dissolves.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Having even one person who knows your struggle and still loves you breaks shame's power. This might be a spouse, a trusted friend, a therapist, a bishop, an accountability partner. Someone who can say, "I know what you've done, and I still see your worth."

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

You were not meant to carry this alone. Part of healing shame is letting others in—carefully, wisely, but letting them in. Connection is the antidote to shame's isolation.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

--- Self-Compassion Practice ---

Let us practice self-compassion now—treating yourself with the kindness you would show a struggling friend.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Place your hand on your heart. Feel its beating—the rhythm of life, the rhythm of hope.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Say to yourself, silently: "This is a moment of suffering. Shame is painful, and I am hurting."

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Now say: "Suffering is part of being human. I am not alone. Many others struggle with these same feelings."

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Now say: "May I be kind to myself. May I give myself the compassion I need."

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

This is not self-indulgence. This is self-compassion—recognizing your pain and responding with kindness rather than condemnation. It is what the Savior does for you, and it is what He invites you to do for yourself.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

--- Replacing Shame with Truth ---

From this day forward, when shame arises, recognize it as a lie. Then replace it with truth.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When shame says, "You are worthless," truth says, "I am a child of God with infinite worth."

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When shame says, "You will never change," truth says, "I am being transformed. My brain is healing. Freedom is coming."

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When shame says, "No one could love you if they knew," truth says, "God knows everything, and He loves me still. Others who know have not rejected me."

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When shame says, "You are your mistakes," truth says, "I am not defined by my behavior. My identity is in Christ."

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Keep a list of shame lies and truth responses. When shame speaks, answer it. Do not let the lies go unchallenged.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

--- Anchor Reinforcement ---

Now, press your thumb and second finger together.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

This anchor now carries healing from shame. It carries the truth of your divine worth. It carries the Savior's love that remains despite everything.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Whenever shame arises, use this anchor. Press thumb and second finger together and remember: I am loved. I am worthy. Shame is a lie. I am not defined by my mistakes.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Hold the pressure. Feel divine love flowing through you.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Release. The healing is taking root.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Future Pacing ---

See yourself tomorrow. Shame tries to arise. You recognize it as a lie. You speak the truth. You feel your worth.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

A week from now. You are living with less shame. The lies have less power. Connection with others is deepening.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

A month from now. Your relationship with yourself has transformed. Self-compassion is replacing self-contempt. You are gentler with yourself.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Six months from now. Shame is no longer the driver of your behavior. The shame cycle is broken. You act from hope, not despair.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

A year from now. You look back and barely recognize the person consumed by shame. You have become someone who knows their worth and lives from that knowledge.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

--- Direct Suggestions ---

And now, as you rest in this deep state, your subconscious mind receives direct suggestions for lasting healing from shame.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You know the difference between guilt and shame. Guilt responds to behavior. Shame attacks identity. You release shame.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Your worth is not determined by your behavior. Your worth is inherent, divine, eternal. No amount of failure can diminish it.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

You are loved by God exactly as you are. His love does not waver based on your performance. It is constant, unconditional, infinite.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

You practice self-compassion. You treat yourself with the kindness the Savior shows you. You are gentle with yourself in struggle.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Shame is losing its power over you. The lies are being replaced with truth. You are healing.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

=== POST-HYPNOTIC SUGGESTIONS (2-3 minutes) ===

As you rest in this state of deep peace, shame is releasing and healing is cementing.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

In the days and weeks ahead, you will notice shame's voice becoming quieter. When it speaks, you will recognize it as a lie and answer with truth.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You will treat yourself with increasing compassion. You will receive divine love more easily. You will feel your worth more naturally.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The shame cycle is breaking. Shame will no longer drive you toward addiction. Instead, you will be driven by hope, by worth, by love.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Remember: you are a son of God. Nothing can change that. Nothing has changed that. You are worthy of love, freedom, and a beautiful future.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== EMERGENCE (3-5 minutes) ===

And now, Austin, it is time to return to full waking consciousness. Everything you have received stays with you. The healing continues even as you return to alertness.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

In a moment, I will count from one to ten. With each number, you'll become more alert, more awake, more refreshed... and more firmly rooted in your true worth.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One. Beginning to return. Healing coming with you.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Two. Becoming more aware of your body. Shame releasing.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Three. The room around you becoming more present. Worth established.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Four. More alert now. Divine love received.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Five. Halfway back. The truth replacing lies.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Six. Your eyes may flutter. You are worthy.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Seven. More and more alert. Lighter than before.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Eight. Almost there. Taking a deep, refreshing breath.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Nine. Ready to open your eyes and live in your worth.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Ten. Eyes open, fully awake, completely alert, and deeply loved.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Welcome back, Austin. Take a moment to appreciate the healing that has occurred. Shame is losing its grip. Truth is taking its place.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You are not your mistakes. You are a child of God, infinitely worthy, eternally loved. Live from that truth, Austin. It will change everything.
