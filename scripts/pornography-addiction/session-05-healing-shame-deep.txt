Duration: ~38 minutes
Voice: Male, British accent, calm and deeply compassionate

[BEGIN SCRIPT]

Welcome, Austin. Today we address something at the heart of this struggle: shame. Shame keeps us trapped. Healing shame sets us free. This may be the most important session yet.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Take a gentle breath in... and release with a sigh.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Another breath, giving yourself permission to feel... and release.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

One more breath... eyes closing, entering safety and healing.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Relax completely. Let every part of you soften. You are safe here. Whatever you feel is okay. Whatever you have done is forgivable.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Now, the staircase. Twenty steps down to deepest healing.

Twenty, nineteen, eighteen, seventeen, sixteen... going deeper.
Fifteen, fourteen, thirteen, twelve, eleven... defenses softening.
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six... heart opening.
Five, four, three, two, one... deep hypnosis achieved.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

shame is different from guilt. Guilt says, I did something bad. Shame says, I am bad. Guilt can motivate change. Shame paralyzes and isolates.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Many with addiction carry deep shame. They feel fundamentally flawed, unworthy of love. This shame often existed before the addiction, and the addiction made it worse.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Here is the tragic irony: shame fuels addiction. When we feel worthless, we seek escape. Pornography and masturbation offer temporary numbing. Then shame increases, and the cycle continues.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

To break the cycle, we must heal the shame. Separate your behavior from your identity. You have done things you regret. But you are not those things. You are a child of God with infinite worth.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The Savior did not come for the righteous. He came for sinners. For the broken, the struggling, the ashamed. He came for you, Austin. His love has never wavered.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

In your imagination now, see yourself as God sees you. Not as your shame tells you. But as He actually sees you.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

He sees His child. He sees the goodness in your heart. He sees your desire to change, your efforts, your tears. He sees someone worth saving.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Feel His love for you now. It is not earned. It is unconditional, infinite, eternal. You are loved, just as you are, in this moment.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let that love wash over you like a warm wave. Let it soak into every place where shame has lived. Let it dissolve the lies.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Your worth was established before you were born. You are a son of God. That identity cannot be changed by your mistakes. It is permanent, eternal.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Shame thrives in secrecy. When we bring struggles into the light, shame dissolves. Having even one person who knows and still loves you breaks shame's power.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The scripture says, confess your faults one to another, that ye may be healed. There is healing power in honest connection. You were not meant to carry this alone.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Allow your mind to present a memory of overwhelming shame. Just acknowledge it. Let it surface gently.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Now imagine the Savior entering that memory. He is there beside you. He is not disgusted. He is compassionate.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

He understands. He took upon Himself not only our sins but our pains, our shame. He felt what you felt so He could know how to succor you.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Hear Him speak: I know. I understand. And I love you still. Nothing can separate you from my love. Come, follow me into freedom.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let His presence in that memory change it. The shame lifts. The darkness becomes light. You are not alone.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

From this day forward, when shame arises, recognize it as a lie. Shame says you are worthless. The truth says you are infinitely valuable.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Replace shame with humble honesty. Yes, I have struggled. But I am not defined by my falls. I am defined by my rising. I am defined by my Savior.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You are being healed. Shame is releasing. Your true identity is emerging. You are worthy of love, freedom, and a beautiful future.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

As I count from one to ten, return to full awareness.

One... beginning to return, lighter than before.
Two... feeling loved and worthy.
Three... becoming alert.
Four... refreshed.
Five... halfway back.
Six... alertness increasing.
Seven... feeling wonderful.
Eight... almost there.
Nine... nearly awake.
Ten... eyes open, fully alert. You are worthy, Austin. Live from that truth.
