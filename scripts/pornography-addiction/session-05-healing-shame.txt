Duration: ~35 minutes
Voice: Male, British accent, calm and deeply compassionate

[BEGIN SCRIPT]

Welcome, Austin. Today we address something that may lie at the very heart of this struggle: shame. Shame keeps us trapped. Healing shame sets us free. This may be the most important session yet.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Take a gentle breath in... and release with a sigh.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Another breath, giving yourself permission to feel... and release.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One more breath, and let your eyes close, entering a space of safety and healing.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Relax completely. Let every part of you soften. You are safe here. Whatever you feel is okay. Whatever you have done is forgivable.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Descend into deep hypnosis. Ten to one. Going down into a place where healing can happen at the deepest level.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

shame is different from guilt. Guilt says, I did something bad. Shame says, I am bad. Guilt can be healthy; it motivates change. But shame is destructive; it paralyzes and isolates.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Many people with addiction carry deep shame. They feel fundamentally flawed, defective, unworthy of love. This shame often existed before the addiction, and the addiction made it worse.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Here is the tragic irony: shame actually fuels addiction. When we feel worthless, we seek escape from that feeling. Pornography offers temporary numbing. But then shame increases, and so the cycle continues.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

To break the cycle, we must heal the shame. We must separate your behavior from your identity. You have done things you regret. But you are not those things. You are a child of God with infinite worth.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The Savior did not come for the righteous. He came for sinners. He came for the broken, the struggling, the ashamed. He came for you. And His love for you has never wavered.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

In your imagination now, I want you to see yourself as God sees you. Not as you fear He sees you. Not as your shame tells you He sees you. But as He actually sees you.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

He sees His child. He sees the goodness in your heart. He sees your desire to change, your efforts, your tears. He sees potential and possibility. He sees someone worth saving.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Feel His love for you now, Austin. It is not earned. It is not based on performance. It is unconditional, infinite, eternal. You are loved, just as you are, in this moment.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let that love wash over you like a warm wave. Let it soak into every place where shame has lived. Let it dissolve the lies that tell you you are worthless.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The truth is, your worth was established before you were born. You are a son of God. That identity cannot be changed by your mistakes. It is permanent, eternal, unshakeable.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Shame thrives in secrecy. It tells you to hide, to never let anyone see your struggle. But secrecy gives shame power. When we bring our struggles into the light, shame begins to dissolve.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You do not need to broadcast your challenges to the world. But having even one trusted person who knows, who still loves you, who walks with you, this breaks shame's power.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Perhaps you have someone like this already. Perhaps you need to find them. A spouse, a close friend, a bishop, a therapist. Someone safe. Someone who will not condemn you but will stand with you.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The scripture says, confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed. There is healing power in honest connection. You were not meant to carry this alone.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Now let us do some deeper healing work. If there are memories of shame, moments where the weight felt crushing, we can bring healing light to them.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Allow your mind to present one such memory. A moment when shame felt overwhelming. You don't need to relive it fully, just acknowledge it. Let it come to the surface gently.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Now imagine the Savior entering that memory with you. He is there beside you in that moment of darkness. He is not disgusted. He is not disappointed. He is compassionate.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

He understands. He took upon Himself not only our sins but our pains, our sorrows, our shame. He felt what you felt so He could know how to succor you.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Hear Him speak to you now: I know. I understand. And I love you still. Nothing you have done can separate you from my love. Come, follow me into freedom.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let His presence in that memory change it. The shame lifts. The darkness becomes light. What was unbearable becomes bearable because you are not alone.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

This healing is real. What happens in hypnosis changes neural patterns. The memories remain, but their emotional charge diminishes. Shame loses its grip.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

From this day forward, when shame arises, you will recognize it as a lie. Shame says you are worthless. The truth says you are infinitely valuable. Shame says you cannot change. The truth says you are already changing.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Replace shame with humble honesty. Yes, I have struggled. Yes, I have fallen. But I am not defined by my falls. I am defined by my rising. I am defined by my Savior.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The Apostle Paul, who once persecuted Christians, wrote most of the New Testament. King David, who committed adultery and murder, was called a man after God's own heart because of his repentance. Your past does not determine your future.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You are being healed. Shame is releasing. Your true identity is emerging. You are worthy of love, worthy of freedom, worthy of a beautiful future.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let all of this settle deeply. The shame is lifting. The love is entering. The truth is taking hold.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

One... beginning to return, lighter than before.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Two... feeling loved and worthy.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Three... becoming alert.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Four... almost fully awake.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Five... eyes open. You are worthy, Austin. Live from that truth.
