[BEGIN SCRIPT]

=== PRE-TALK / SETTLING (2-3 minutes) ===

Welcome, Austin. You have been doing powerful work. Today we address something that will transform not just your behavior, but who you are: your identity.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Most recovery efforts focus on stopping behaviors. But lasting change comes from becoming someone different—someone for whom the old behaviors are simply not an option. Not through willpower, but through identity.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Today you will understand the power of identity in driving behavior, shed the old identity that was bound to addiction, and step fully into your new identity as a free man. This is perhaps the most transformative session yet.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The scripture speaks of becoming a new creature in Christ. This is not just theology—it is psychology. Identity change is real, and it is happening in you now.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Find a comfortable position. Allow your body to settle. This session will complete a transformation that has been building throughout our work together. Let us begin.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== INDUCTION - Eye Fatigue with Diaphragmatic Breathing (10-12 minutes) ===

Begin by finding a spot on the ceiling or wall, slightly above your natural line of sight. A spot that requires you to look upward without straining your neck.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Focus on that spot. Keep your eyes fixed there as you begin to breathe deeply. Diaphragmatic breathing—belly expanding as you breathe in, sinking as you breathe out.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Breathe in through your nose... belly rising gently... hold for a moment... and release through your mouth. With this exhale, your new identity becomes clearer.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Continue gazing at that spot. Notice how your eyes begin to feel. A slight strain. A heaviness developing. This is natural and welcome. With each breath, this heaviness increases.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Another breath now... deeper than before... belly expanding... hold... and release. The old self is fading. The new self is emerging.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Keep your eyes on that spot. They are growing heavier. The muscles around your eyes are tiring. Some of you may notice a watering of the eyes. Others feel a pulling sensation. Both are signs that hypnosis is developing.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Breathe in once more... letting the breath fill your entire chest cavity... hold... and as you exhale, notice your eyes wanting to close. When the desire becomes strong enough, allow them to close naturally.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

If your eyes have not yet closed, take another breath and let them close with the exhale. There is no rush. Your eyes will close when they are ready.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Eyes now closed... feel the relief. The muscles that were straining are now resting. This is the first transformation—the first letting go. And it feels wonderful.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Now that your eyes are closed, bring your attention to your breathing. Allow each breath to deepen the relaxation flowing through your body.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

With your next breath, focus on your scalp. Feel it softening, relaxing. Any tension held there simply melting away. Warmth spreading across the top of your head.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

This warmth flows down to your forehead. Feel the muscles of your forehead smoothing out. All worry lines dissolving. Your forehead becoming cool, calm, completely relaxed.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Down to your eyes now—those tired muscles resting deeply. Your eyelids becoming wonderfully heavy. As though tiny weights are gently pressing them down. So heavy that you have no desire to open them.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The relaxation spreads to your cheeks and jaw. Your jaw becoming slack. Your teeth parting slightly. All the tension that accumulates in your jaw throughout the day—released now. Melting away like ice in warm water.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Down into your neck. Feel each vertebra of your neck relaxing. The muscles on the sides and back of your neck becoming loose like warm rubber. Your head feeling balanced and light.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The wave of relaxation flows into your shoulders. Shoulders are where we carry so much of life's burden. Feel yours dropping now. Releasing their load. Becoming soft and heavy.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Down through your arms. The relaxation flowing like warm honey through your upper arms... your elbows... your forearms. Into your wrists and hands. Each finger becoming loose and heavy.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Your chest now. Feel your breathing becoming even slower, even deeper. Your heart beating calmly, steadily. A sense of peace filling your entire chest cavity.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The warmth spreads through your stomach. Any knots or butterflies dissolving completely. Your stomach becoming soft and relaxed. All digestive tension released.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Into your lower back—that area that works so hard. Feel it softening. The muscles along your spine releasing their grip. Your entire back sinking into whatever supports you.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Through your hips now, releasing any tightness held there. Down into your thighs. Your large leg muscles becoming completely limp, loose, and heavy. Like lead weights.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Past your knees, into your calves. These muscles that carry you through each day—resting now. Completely at peace.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Into your ankles, your feet, your toes. Every muscle, every joint, every cell of your body now bathed in deep relaxation.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

You are deeply relaxed, Austin. Your body is at peace. Your mind is calm and receptive. With each breath, you go deeper. The better you feel, the deeper you go. The deeper you go, the more complete your transformation becomes.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== DEEPENING - 20-Step Staircase (8-10 minutes) ===

In your mind's eye, you find yourself at the top of a beautiful staircase. This staircase has twenty steps, and it leads down to a transformation chamber—a place where the old self is released and the new self emerges.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The banister is smooth beneath your hand. The steps are solid and safe. With each step you descend, you will go twice as deep into hypnosis, and your identity will shift more fully into who you are becoming.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Step twenty. Taking the first step down. Feeling relaxation deepen. Transformation beginning.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step nineteen. Going deeper. The old self starting to fade.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step eighteen. Deeper still. New identity forming.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step seventeen. Every step takes you deeper. Every step transforms you.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step sixteen. Mind quieting. Identity shifting.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step fifteen. Halfway there. So deep already. So new.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step fourteen. The old patterns are dissolving. New patterns are forming.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step thirteen. Deeper than before. Profoundly transformed.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step twelve. Your subconscious is wide open, ready for new programming.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step eleven. So peaceful. So ready for your new self.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step ten. Entering the deepest levels now. The transformation chamber is near.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step nine. Every suggestion about your new identity will be received powerfully.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step eight. Going deeper still.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step seven. Profound identity transformation developing.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step six. Almost there, Austin.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step five. So deep now. The new you is almost fully emerged.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step four. Deeper than you have ever been.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step three. The transformation chamber is just ahead.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step two. One more step.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step one. You step off the staircase into the transformation chamber. You are in the deepest state of hypnosis. Here, the old identity is released and the new identity is sealed. Everything you hear will be absorbed completely by your subconscious mind.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== THERAPEUTIC CONTENT (15-18 minutes) ===

--- Identity Drives Behavior ---

Austin, let us begin with a fundamental truth: identity drives behavior. Who you believe you are determines what you do.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Consider someone who has never smoked. They do not struggle to resist cigarettes. It is not willpower—it is identity. Smoking is simply not something they do. It is not part of who they are.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Now consider someone who sees themselves as a smoker trying to quit. Every day is a battle. They use willpower to resist. But their identity is still a smoker—just one who is temporarily not smoking. Eventually, most return to the behavior that matches their identity.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The same principle applies to your struggle. If you see yourself as an addict fighting pornography and masturbation, you will fight forever. But if you see yourself as a free man for whom these behaviors are simply not options—freedom becomes natural.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- The Old Identity ---

For years, perhaps, you have carried an identity shaped by this struggle. The inner labels: "addict," "broken," "weak," "dirty," "hopeless." These labels became part of how you saw yourself.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This identity was formed by many things. By repeated failures. By secret shame. By the voice that said, "This is just who you are." But this identity was a lie—a distortion of your true nature.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The addiction convinced you that you were the addiction. That your struggle defined you. That you would always be someone who fights this battle. But you are not your struggle. You never were.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Today, we release the old identity completely. It has served its purpose—it taught you lessons, showed you your need for the Savior, built your empathy for others who struggle. But it is time to let it go.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Releasing the Old Self ---

In the gospel, we call this putting off the natural man. The scriptures speak of becoming a new creature in Christ, old things passing away, all things becoming new. This is actual psychological transformation, not just metaphor.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Imagine now that you are standing in this transformation chamber. In front of you is a door marked "Old Self." Behind that door are all the labels, all the shame, all the failure, all the identity wrapped up in addiction.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This is not a door you need to open again. Instead, imagine turning a key—locking that door forever. The old self is behind that locked door. You are no longer him.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Feel the release. Feel the lightness. The labels fall away. "Addict"—gone. "Broken"—gone. "Weak"—gone. You are no longer defined by your struggle.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Your True Identity ---

Now, let us define who you truly are. Not who the addiction told you that you were. Not who shame labeled you. But who you actually are.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You are a son of God. This is your primary identity. Before any behavior, before any struggle, before any label—you are His child. This cannot be changed by your mistakes.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You are someone with infinite worth. Your value was established before you were born. It is intrinsic, permanent, eternal. No addiction can diminish it. No failure can erase it.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You are someone capable of change. The brain is plastic. New neural pathways are forming. Old patterns are being replaced. You have the capacity to become completely different.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You are someone the Savior died for. He saw you across time—saw your struggle, your failures, your shame—and went to the cross anyway. You were worth His sacrifice. You still are.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Your New Identity Defined ---

Now let us be specific. Who are you becoming? Let us define your new identity clearly, so it can take root in your subconscious.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You are becoming a man of integrity. Your private life matches your public life. There are no hidden compartments, no secret struggles, nothing to hide. You walk in the light in every area of your life.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You are becoming a man of self-mastery. Your appetites and desires are subject to your will, not the other way around. You are the master of your own house. Your body serves you; you do not serve it.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You are becoming a man of real connection. You value genuine relationships over counterfeit intimacy. You invest in people, not pixels. Your capacity for true intimacy is growing.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You are becoming a man of purpose. Your energy goes toward meaningful goals, not escape into fantasy. You are building, creating, serving, growing.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You are becoming a man of faith. You rely on the Savior's strength, not just your own willpower. You access His enabling power daily. You are an instrument in His hands.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This is who you are becoming. Not someday. Now. The transformation is happening. The new identity is taking hold.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Installing the New Identity ---

Let us now install this new identity at the deepest level. I will make statements about who you are. As you hear them, allow them to sink into your subconscious as absolute truth.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

I am a child of God with infinite worth.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

I am someone who does not use pornography. It is simply not part of who I am.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

I am a man of integrity, whose private and public life match.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

I am a master of my appetites. They serve me; I do not serve them.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

I am someone who chooses real connection over counterfeit intimacy.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

I am becoming stronger, freer, and more whole every day.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

I am being transformed by the power of Christ.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

These statements are now installed at the deepest level. They are your new operating system.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Seeing Your Future Self ---

Austin, see now your future self. Step into this person who is you—fully transformed, fully free.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

See him waking in the morning. He rises with purpose. He connects with Heavenly Father in prayer. He moves through his day with confidence and peace. There is nothing to hide.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

See him encountering what used to be triggers. Old images, old situations, old feelings. But now they barely register. They are remnants of an old life that is no longer his. He is simply not someone who responds to those triggers anymore.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

See him in relationships. He is present, engaged, fully attentive. There is no distraction of secret struggles. No mental compartments hidden from those he loves. He gives his full self because there is only one self—the integrated, whole self.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

See him at night, going to bed. His conscience is clear. No shame, no secrets, no regret from the day. He rests peacefully, knowing he has lived with integrity. This is freedom.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Now, merge with this future self. Let his identity become yours. Let his confidence become yours. Let his freedom become yours. You are not seeing someone different—you are seeing who you are becoming. Who you already are.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Anchor Reinforcement ---

Press your thumb and second finger together now.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

This anchor carries your new identity. All the truth of who you are—child of God, man of integrity, master of your appetites, free from this addiction.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Feel all of this identity flowing into this anchor. The old self is locked away. The new self is fully present. You are not fighting to be someone you are not. You are simply being who you truly are.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Whenever the old identity tries to resurface, whenever old labels try to attach, use this anchor and remember: That is not who I am. I am a new creation. I am free.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Release the anchor now. The identity is sealed.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Living from Identity ---

From now on, you will live from your new identity rather than toward it.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When temptation comes—and it will, occasionally—respond from identity. Ask yourself: Is this what someone like me does? The answer is no. You are someone who does not do this. End of conversation.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You do not resist from willpower alone. You resist from identity. It is the difference between "I want to do this but must not" and "I simply do not do this." The second requires no willpower—it flows naturally from who you are.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Every choice you make reinforces your identity. Every time you choose according to who you are, the identity deepens. Every day, you become more fully the person you were always meant to be.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Scripture of New Creation ---

The Savior said, "Ye must be born again." This is not just about salvation—it is about transformation. You are being born again. The old self is dying. The new self is rising.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The Apostle Paul wrote, "If any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new." This is your reality now. Old things have passed. All things are becoming new.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You are a new creation, Austin. The transformation is complete. Walk in newness of life.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== POST-HYPNOTIC SUGGESTIONS (2-3 minutes) ===

Your subconscious now holds your new identity with unshakeable certainty. You know who you are. It is no longer a question.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When old labels try to attach, they will slide off. You are not an addict. You are not broken. You are not your past. You are a new creation.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When temptation arises, you will respond from identity: This is not what someone like me does. The response will be automatic, effortless.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Every day, your new identity will strengthen. Every choice aligned with who you are will deepen the transformation. You are becoming more fully yourself with each passing day.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The old self is behind a locked door. You have no desire to open it. You have moved on. You are free.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== EMERGENCE (3-5 minutes) ===

It is time to return to full awareness, carrying your new identity with you.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

In a moment, I will count from one to ten. With each number, you will become more alert, more awake, while your new identity remains permanently installed.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One. Beginning the journey back. Identity transformation complete.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Two. Feeling energy returning to your body. The new you is fully present.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Three. Becoming aware of your surroundings. Old self released.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Four. Your mind clearing. New identity sealed.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Five. Halfway back now. Feeling wonderful. Transformed.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Six. More alert with each breath. Living from new identity.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Seven. Almost there. Walking in newness of life.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Eight. Eyes preparing to open. New creation awakening.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Nine. Nearly fully awake. Taking a deep, energizing breath.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Ten. Eyes open, fully alert, completely refreshed, and completely transformed.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Welcome back, Austin. You are a new creation. The old has passed away. Everything is becoming new.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Live from your new identity now. You are a child of God, a man of integrity, a master of your appetites, free from addiction. This is who you are. This is who you have always been beneath the struggle. Now it is fully revealed. Walk in this truth. It will change everything.
