Duration: ~38 minutes
Voice: Male, British accent, calm and compassionate

[BEGIN SCRIPT]

Welcome, Austin. Today we focus on identity transformation. You are not just stopping a behavior. You are becoming a new person. A person for whom this addiction is foreign.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Take a deep breath in... and release.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Another breath, connecting to who you are becoming... and release.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

One more breath... eyes closing, entering transformation.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Relax completely. Allow peace to fill every part of you.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Now, the staircase. Twenty steps down.

Twenty, nineteen, eighteen, seventeen, sixteen... going deeper.
Fifteen, fourteen, thirteen, twelve, eleven... old self releasing.
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six... new self emerging.
Five, four, three, two, one... deep hypnosis achieved.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

identity drives behavior. If you see yourself as an addict struggling to resist, resistance is constant effort. But if you see yourself as a free man who simply does not do this thing, freedom is natural.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Consider someone who has never smoked. They don't struggle to resist cigarettes. It's not willpower; it's identity. Smoking isn't something they do.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You are transitioning from someone who fights these behaviors to someone for whom pornography and masturbation are simply not options. This is genuine change in who you are.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The old identity was shaped by many factors. But identity can be chosen. You decide who you want to be. That decision, reinforced over time, becomes reality.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

In the gospel, we call this becoming a new creature in Christ. The old man is put off, the new man is put on. This is actual psychological transformation.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

So who are you becoming? Let us define this clearly.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

You are becoming a man of integrity. Your private life matches your public life. You have nothing to hide. You walk in the light.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

You are becoming a man of self-mastery. Your appetites do not control you. You control them. You are the master of your own house.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

You are becoming a man of connection. You value real relationships over counterfeit intimacy. You invest in people, not pixels.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

You are becoming a man of service. Your energy goes toward blessing others, not escaping into fantasy.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

You are becoming a man of faith. You rely on the Savior. You access His enabling power. You are an instrument in His hands.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This is who you are becoming. Feel it. Own it. Let this identity settle into every fiber of your being.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Step into this future Austin. See him in his daily life. He wakes with purpose. He connects with Heavenly Father. He moves through his day with confidence and peace.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When he encounters triggers, they barely register. They are remnants of an old life. He is no longer that person. Temptation has no foothold because identity has changed.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

See him in relationships. Present. Engaged. Not distracted by secret struggles. He gives full attention because nothing steals it away.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

See him at night, going to bed with clear conscience. No shame, no secrecy. He rests peacefully, whole and integrated. This is freedom.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This future is not fantasy. He is emerging. With every session, every day of sobriety, every tool you use, he becomes more real. You are already becoming him.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Merge with this future self now. Let his identity become yours. Let his confidence become yours. Let his freedom become yours.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The Savior said, Ye must be born again. You are being born again. The old self is dying. The new self is rising.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When temptation comes, respond from this new identity. I am not someone who does that. That is not who I am. Mean it. And it will be true.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

you are a new creation. The old is passing away. The new has come. Walk in this newness of life.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

As I count from one to ten, return to full awareness.

One... beginning to return.
Two... carrying your new identity.
Three... becoming alert.
Four... refreshed.
Five... halfway back.
Six... alertness increasing.
Seven... feeling wonderful.
Eight... almost there.
Nine... nearly awake.
Ten... eyes open, fully alert. You are a new creation, Austin. Live like it.
