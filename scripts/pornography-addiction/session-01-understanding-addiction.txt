Duration: ~34 minutes
Voice: Male, British accent, calm and compassionate

[BEGIN SCRIPT]

Welcome, Austin. By coming to this session, you have shown tremendous courage. Many struggle in silence, but you have chosen to seek healing. The Savior honors that choice, and so do I.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Find a comfortable position and allow yourself to settle. This is a safe space, free from judgment. You are here for healing, and healing is what you will receive.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Take a deep breath in... and let it go, releasing any shame or guilt you carry.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Another breath, deeper... and as you exhale, know that you are loved, just as you are, right now.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

One more breath, and let your eyes close, entering a state of peace where transformation can begin.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let relaxation flow through your body now. Starting at your head, moving down through your face, your neck, your shoulders. Feel everything softening, releasing.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The relaxation continues through your arms, your chest, your stomach. Down through your hips, your legs, to your feet. Your entire body is at peace.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let us descend deeper now. Ten steps down into a state of openness and receptivity.

Ten... relaxing more.
Nine... letting go of tension.
Eight... deeper peace.
Seven... safe and secure.
Six... going deeper.
Five... halfway there.
Four... mind opening.
Three... almost there.
Two... one more step.
One... you are now in a deep hypnotic state, ready for healing.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

today we begin by understanding what you are facing. Pornography addiction is real. It affects millions of people, including many faithful members of the Church. You are not alone in this struggle, and you are not uniquely broken.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Pornography hijacks the brain's reward system. It releases dopamine, the same chemical involved in other addictions. Over time, the brain becomes conditioned to seek this artificial stimulation. This is not a moral failing. It is a neurological pattern that has formed.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

But here is the hope: the brain can be rewired. What has been learned can be unlearned. The same neuroplasticity that created the addiction can be harnessed to heal it. You are not permanently damaged. You are temporarily conditioned, and that conditioning can change.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Understanding this removes some of the shame. You are not a bad person. You are a good person with a brain pattern that needs to change. The Savior sees your heart. He knows your desire to be free. And He will help you.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The addiction typically follows a cycle. First, there is a trigger, something that activates the craving. Then there is a ritual, the behaviors that lead up to acting out. Then the acting out itself. And finally, shame and guilt, which often leads back to the trigger. A vicious cycle.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

In these sessions, we will interrupt this cycle at every point. You will learn to recognize and manage triggers. You will disrupt the rituals. You will build new responses. And you will replace shame with grace.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let us talk about triggers. The acronym HALT represents the most common ones. H for Hungry, A for Angry, L for Lonely, T for Tired. When you experience any of these states, your vulnerability increases.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Hungry doesn't just mean physical hunger. It can mean any unmet need, starved for attention, starved for connection, starved for success. When needs go unmet, we seek substitutes.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Angry covers all negative emotions, frustration, resentment, stress, disappointment. These feelings create discomfort, and the brain has learned that pornography temporarily numbs discomfort.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Lonely is perhaps the most powerful trigger. We are created for connection. When we feel isolated, disconnected, unimportant, the brain seeks comfort. Pornography provides a counterfeit connection.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Tired means physical exhaustion, but also mental and spiritual fatigue. When willpower is depleted, resistance weakens. Late nights alone are high-risk times.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

From now on, Austin, you will become aware of your HALT status. Multiple times each day, you will check in with yourself. Am I Hungry? Am I Angry? Am I Lonely? Am I Tired? This awareness is your early warning system.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When you notice any of these states, you will address the underlying need directly. If hungry, eat or identify what you truly need. If angry, process the emotion healthily. If lonely, reach out to connect with someone. If tired, rest.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Addressing the real need removes the fuel for the addiction. Pornography was never about pornography. It was about meeting needs in an unhealthy way. When you meet needs in healthy ways, the craving diminishes.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The Savior said, Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. He knows your weariness. He knows the weight you carry. And He offers true rest, not the false escape of addiction.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

In the coming sessions, you will build a complete system for freedom. You will create boundaries. You will rewire your brain's reward system. You will develop healthier ways to cope with life's difficulties. You will build accountability. And you will transform your identity from someone who struggles with this to someone who is free.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

But today, we plant the seeds. Understanding is the beginning. You now know what you face. You know it is a brain pattern, not a character flaw. You know the cycle. You know the triggers. And you know that change is possible.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let these truths sink deep into your subconscious mind. You are capable of overcoming this. Many have walked this path before you and found freedom. You will join them.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The Lord has not abandoned you. Even in your darkest moments, He has been there, waiting for you to turn to Him. And now you have. This is the beginning of your liberation.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Remember the words from the Book of Mormon: I know that man is nothing, which thing I never had supposed. But recognizing our weakness is the beginning of strength. For when we are weak, then we are strong in Christ.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You are on the path now. Stay committed. Return to these sessions. Do the daily work. And you will be free.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

It is time to return to waking awareness, carrying this understanding with you.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

One... beginning to return.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Two... feeling hopeful and determined.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Three... becoming more alert.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Four... almost fully awake.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Five... eyes open, fully alert. You have begun a sacred journey, Austin. Continue with faith.
