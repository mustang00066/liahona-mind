Duration: ~33 minutes
Voice: Male, British accent, calm and compassionate

[BEGIN SCRIPT]

Welcome back, Austin. You have returned, which shows your commitment. Each session builds upon the last, strengthening your path to freedom. Let us continue.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Take a deep breath in, gathering your resolve... and release.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Another breath, connecting with your desire for freedom... and release.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One more breath, and let your eyes close, entering hypnosis easily now.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let relaxation wash through you quickly. Your body knows this state. Head to toe, release and relax. Deeper and deeper.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Descend now. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Deep hypnotic state.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

today we create clear boundaries using a powerful model called the Three Circles. This model, used in recovery programs worldwide, helps you define exactly what you are avoiding, what is dangerous, and what is healthy.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Imagine three concentric circles. The innermost circle is red, the danger zone. The middle circle is yellow, the warning zone. The outer circle is green, the safety zone.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

The inner circle contains behaviors you are committed to avoiding completely. These are your bottom-line behaviors. For most people in your situation, this includes viewing pornography in any form, masturbation to fantasy, and any other sexual behaviors outside of marriage that you are committed to stopping.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The inner circle is not about rules imposed from outside. It is about what you personally commit to. You are defining your sobriety. You are drawing your line.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Take a moment now, to clarify your inner circle. What specific behaviors are you committing to abstain from completely? Let your subconscious mind identify these clearly.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

These behaviors are now marked clearly in your mind. They are the red zone. They are off limits. When you approach them, alarms will sound.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The middle circle, the yellow zone, contains warning behaviors. These are not inherently wrong, but they lead toward the inner circle. They are the steps in the ritual that precedes acting out.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Middle circle behaviors might include browsing social media excessively, staying up late alone with a device, isolating yourself when stressed, looking at suggestive but not explicit content, or any personal pattern that typically precedes a relapse.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The middle circle is important because this is where intervention is easiest. If you can recognize when you are in the yellow zone, you can turn back before reaching the red zone.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Think now about your personal warning behaviors. What do you typically do in the hours or days before acting out? What is your ritual? Let your subconscious identify these patterns.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

These behaviors are now flagged in your mind. When you notice them, a yellow warning light will activate. You will recognize: I am moving toward danger. I need to change course.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The outer circle, the green zone, contains healthy behaviors. These are the activities that support your recovery and your life. Things like prayer, scripture study, exercise, connection with loved ones, productive work, hobbies, sleep, and healthy recreation.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The green circle is not just the absence of bad behavior. It is the presence of good behavior. Recovery is not only about what you stop doing. It is about what you start doing.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When you fill your life with green circle activities, you leave less room and less need for red circle behaviors. An abundant life crowds out addiction.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The Savior said, I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly. He wants you to have a full, rich, meaningful life. The green circle is your path to that abundance.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Now let us install these circles deeply into your subconscious mind. Visualize them clearly. The red inner circle, absolutely off limits. The yellow middle circle, warning territory. The green outer circle, where you want to live.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

See yourself going about your daily life. Most of the time, you are in the green zone. Engaged in healthy activities. Connected to what matters. Living your values.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Occasionally, you notice yourself drifting toward the yellow zone. Perhaps you are isolating. Perhaps you are mindlessly browsing. The yellow warning activates. You recognize it immediately.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

And when that warning comes, you take action. You stop the yellow behavior. You reach out to someone. You redirect to the green zone. Crisis averted. Sobriety maintained.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This is how you will live, Austin. With clear boundaries. With early warning systems. With immediate course correction. The red zone becomes distant, because you never let yourself get close to it.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Physical boundaries also matter. Your devices need protection. If you don't already have content filters, you will install them. Your computer, your phone, your tablet. These tools should serve your freedom, not your addiction.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Consider where you use your devices. Are there high-risk locations? Times when you are alone and vulnerable? Create boundaries around these. Move devices to public spaces. Set time limits. Do what you need to do.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The Apostle Paul counseled to flee fornication. Sometimes the best strategy is simply to remove yourself from the situation. If a device or location is too tempting, change the situation. This is wisdom, not weakness.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your boundaries are now being programmed into your subconscious. The three circles are clear. The warning systems are active. The physical boundaries are identified. You have built walls of protection around your sobriety.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Remember, boundaries are not prisons. They are gardens. They define the space where beautiful things can grow. Within your boundaries, you cultivate the life you want to live.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

In the next session, we will work on rewiring your brain's response to triggers. But for now, let your boundaries settle firmly in place.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

One... beginning to return.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Two... boundaries are established.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Three... feeling protected and clear.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Four... almost fully awake.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Five... eyes open. Your boundaries are in place, Austin. Honor them, and they will honor you.
