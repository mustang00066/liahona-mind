Duration: ~28 minutes
Voice: Male, British accent, calm and compassionate

[BEGIN SCRIPT]

Welcome, Austin. Today we address the power of connection. Addiction thrives in isolation. Recovery flourishes in relationship. You were never meant to fight alone.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Take a deep breath in... and release.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Another breath... and release.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One more breath... eyes closing, entering peace.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Relax completely. Deep peace flowing through you.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Descend now. Ten to one. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Deep hypnosis.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Austin, we are only as sick as our secrets. Secrecy gives addiction power. When we bring struggles into light, shame dissolves.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You need at least one person who knows the full truth. A spouse, friend, priesthood leader, therapist, or sponsor. Your accountability partner.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

See yourself reaching out to this person. Being honest. Instead of rejection, you receive acceptance. They see you as brave.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Feel the relief. The weight is now shared. Someone knows and still cares. This is freedom's beginning.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Establish regular check-ins. Daily text. Weekly call. Knowing you will report adds weight to choices.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When tempted, reach out before acting. A simple message can break temptation's spell.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

If you fall, tell them quickly. Quick confession prevents shame from compounding.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Support groups like the Church's Addiction Recovery Program provide community. You discover others share your struggle and have found freedom.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Isolation is a lie. Vulnerability creates connection. Let yourself be known.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

See yourself in the future. A network of support. No longer alone. Living in the light. Connected. Free.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One... beginning to return.
Two... feeling connected.
Three... becoming alert.
Four... refreshed.
Five... eyes open, fully alert. Reach out to someone, Austin. Let yourself be known.
