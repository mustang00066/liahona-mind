=== PRE-TALK / SETTLING (1-2 minutes) ===

Welcome, Austin. This session addresses something at the heart of your struggle: shame. Shame keeps us trapped. Healing shame sets us free. This may be the most important session yet.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Shame is different from guilt. Guilt says, "I did something bad." Shame says, "I am bad." Today we heal the shame so it no longer drives your behavior.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Whatever you feel in this session is welcome. Whatever you have done is forgivable. You are safe, and you are loved. Let us begin.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== INDUCTION - Rapid Relaxation with Breathing (5-6 minutes) ===

Take a gentle breath now. Diaphragmatic breathing—belly expanding as you breathe in, sinking as you breathe out.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Breathe in through your nose... belly rising... hold gently... and release with a sigh. With this exhale, shame begins to release.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Another breath... deeper... and as you exhale, allow your eyes to close naturally.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let your neck become loose like rubber bands. Head floating like a helium balloon. Jaws sagging. Shoulders dropping—all the weight you carry there falling away.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Arms becoming limp, loose, and heavy. All the way down to your hands.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Legs and feet the same. The better you feel, the deeper you go. The deeper you go, the more healing occurs.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Your eyelids becoming wonderfully heavy. As though gently stuck together. You are safe in this place of healing.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== DEEPENING (3-4 minutes) ===

Imagine yourself at the top of a staircase... ten steps leading down to a sanctuary of healing.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Ten. Stepping down. Defenses softening.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Nine. Deeper. Your heart opening.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Eight. Shame beginning to loosen.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Seven. Deeper still.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Six. Halfway there.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Five. So deep. So safe.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Four. Almost there.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Three. Deep healing.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Two. One more step.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

One. You step into a sanctuary where shame dissolves and you know your true worth.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== THERAPEUTIC CONTENT (8-10 minutes) ===

Receive only what serves you. Your subconscious mind will accept what is true for you and let the rest go.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

--- The Shame Cycle ---

Austin, here is something essential: shame fuels addiction.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When we feel worthless, we seek escape. Pornography and masturbation offer temporary numbing. But afterward, shame increases. The cycle goes: shame → seeking relief → acting out → more shame.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

To break free, we must heal the shame. Willpower alone is not enough when a shame engine is driving the behavior.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Separating Behavior from Identity ---

The first step is separating behavior from identity.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

You have done things you regret. This is true. But you are not those things. Your behavior does not define you.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Say this in your mind: "I have done things I regret. But I am not defined by what I have done. My behavior does not determine my worth."

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

A person who struggles is still a person—still a child of God, still infinitely valuable. The struggle does not erase the value.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Your Divine Worth ---

Your worth was established before you were born. You are a son of God. This identity cannot be changed by your mistakes.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

No amount of failure can erase your divine origin. Your worth is intrinsic, permanent, eternal.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The Savior did not come for the righteous. He came for sinners. For the broken and ashamed. He came for you, Austin. His love has never wavered.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Receiving Divine Love ---

See yourself now as God sees you. Not as shame tells you. But as He actually sees you.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

He sees His child. He sees the goodness in your heart. He sees your desire to change, your efforts, your tears. He sees someone infinitely precious.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Feel His love now. It is unconditional, infinite, eternal. Let it wash over you like a warm wave. Let it dissolve the lies of shame.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Healing a Shameful Memory ---

Allow your mind to present a memory where you felt overwhelming shame. Just one memory. You are safe.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Now imagine the Savior entering that memory. He is not distant or disgusted. He is close and compassionate.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Hear Him speak: "I know. I understand. And I love you still. Nothing can separate you from my love."

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let His presence change the memory. The shame lifts. Darkness becomes light. You are not alone.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Self-Compassion ---

Practice treating yourself with kindness rather than condemnation.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

When shame speaks, recognize it as a lie. Replace it with truth.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

When shame says, "You are worthless," truth says, "I am a child of God with infinite worth."

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

When shame says, "You will never change," truth says, "I am being transformed. Freedom is coming."

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

When shame says, "You are your mistakes," truth says, "I am not defined by my behavior."

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Anchor Reinforcement ---

Press your thumb and second finger together now.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

This anchor carries healing from shame. It carries your divine worth. It carries the Savior's love that remains despite everything.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Whenever shame arises, use this anchor and remember: I am loved. I am worthy. Shame is a lie.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Release. The healing is taking root.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

--- Breaking Shame Through Connection ---

Shame thrives in secrecy. When we bring struggles into the light, shame dissolves.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Having even one person who knows and still loves you breaks shame's power. You were not meant to carry this alone.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Connection is the antidote to shame's isolation.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== POST-HYPNOTIC SUGGESTIONS (1 minute) ===

Your subconscious now holds the truth: your worth is not determined by your behavior. You are loved by God exactly as you are.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

When shame speaks, you will recognize it as a lie and answer with truth.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

The shame cycle is breaking. You are healing.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== EMERGENCE (2-3 minutes) ===

It is time to return to full awareness, carrying this healing with you.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

I will count from one to five. With each number, you become more alert while the healing continues.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

One. Beginning to return. Healing coming with you.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Two. More aware of your body. Shame releasing.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Three. Energy returning. Divine love received.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Four. Almost fully alert. Worth established.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Five. Eyes open, fully awake, completely alert, and deeply loved.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Welcome back, Austin. Shame is losing its grip. Truth is taking its place.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

You are not your mistakes. You are a child of God, infinitely worthy, eternally loved. Live from that truth. It will change everything.
