Duration: ~28 minutes

[BEGIN SCRIPT]

Welcome, Austin. Today we heal shame. Shame keeps us trapped. Healing shame sets us free.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Take a gentle breath in... and release with a sigh.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Another breath, giving yourself permission to feel... and release.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One more breath... eyes closing, entering safety.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Relax completely. You are safe here. Whatever you feel is okay. Whatever you have done is forgivable.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Descend now. Ten to one. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Deep hypnosis.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Austin, shame says I am bad. Guilt says I did something bad. Guilt motivates change. Shame paralyzes.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Shame fuels addiction. We feel worthless, seek escape, then shame increases. A vicious cycle.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

To break free, separate behavior from identity. You have done things you regret. You are not those things. You are a child of God.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The Savior came for sinners. For the broken and ashamed. He came for you. His love has never wavered.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

See yourself as God sees you. He sees His child. He sees goodness, desire to change, someone worth saving.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Feel His love now. Unconditional, infinite, eternal. Let it wash over you. Let it dissolve the lies of shame.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your worth is permanent. You are a son of God. Mistakes cannot change that.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Imagine a memory of shame. Let the Savior enter it. He is not disgusted. He is compassionate. He says, I know. I love you still.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

His presence changes the memory. Shame lifts. Darkness becomes light. You are not alone.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When shame arises, recognize it as a lie. You are not defined by falls. You are defined by rising. By your Savior.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You are worthy of love, freedom, and a beautiful future.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One... beginning to return, lighter.
Two... feeling loved and worthy.
Three... becoming alert.
Four... refreshed.
Five... eyes open, fully alert. You are worthy, Austin. Live from that truth.
