Duration: ~38 minutes
Voice: Male, British accent, calm and compassionate

[BEGIN SCRIPT]

Welcome back, Austin. Today we rewire your brain. The pathways that led to addiction will weaken. New pathways of freedom will strengthen.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Take a deep breath in... and release.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Another breath, deeper... your brain ready to change.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

One more breath... eyes closing, entering neuroplasticity.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let relaxation flow through you. Head to toe. Complete peace.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Now, the staircase. Twenty steps down.

Twenty, nineteen, eighteen, seventeen, sixteen... brain resetting.
Fifteen, fourteen, thirteen, twelve, eleven... pathways changing.
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six... healing occurring.
Five, four, three, two, one... deep hypnosis achieved.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Austin, your brain has been conditioned by pornography and masturbation. Each time you viewed or acted out, you strengthened certain neural pathways. These pathways now fire automatically in response to triggers.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

But the brain is plastic—it changes based on how you use it. Neurons that fire together, wire together. Neurons that stop firing together, unwire. This is your path to freedom.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Each day you abstain, the old pathways weaken. Each time you choose something healthy instead, new pathways strengthen. Your brain is literally rewiring itself.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The dopamine system that was hijacked is recalibrating. At first, normal pleasures may feel dull. This is withdrawal. It passes. Sensitivity returns. Real life becomes rewarding again.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

See in your mind's eye the old pathways—dark, overgrown paths leading to pornography and masturbation. Watch them becoming faint, overgrown with disuse, disappearing.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Now see new pathways forming—bright, clear roads leading to healthy pleasures. Connection with loved ones. Accomplishment in work. Physical activity. Spiritual peace. These paths grow stronger daily.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The scripture speaks of putting off the natural man. Your addicted brain patterns are the natural man. Through the Atonement and your efforts, you put them off and become new.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Healthy habits accelerate rewiring. Exercise releases natural dopamine. Quality sleep restores brain chemistry. Nutrition supports healing. Social connection satisfies the need pornography counterfeited.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When urges arise, remember they are just old pathways firing. They are memories, not commands. You can observe them without obeying. Each time you let an urge pass, the pathway weakens.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your brain heals faster than you might think. Significant changes occur in weeks. Within months, the pull of addiction dramatically decreases. Within a year, freedom becomes natural.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

See yourself a year from now. Your brain is healed. The old pathways are gone. You no longer think about pornography or feel compelled to masturbate. You are free.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

As I count from one to ten, return to full awareness.

One... beginning to return.
Two... brain rewiring.
Three... becoming alert.
Four... refreshed.
Five... halfway back.
Six... alertness increasing.
Seven... feeling wonderful.
Eight... almost there.
Nine... nearly awake.
Ten... eyes open, fully alert. Your brain is changing, Austin. Keep healing.
