=== PRE-TALK / SETTLING (1-2 minutes) ===

Welcome, Austin. You have come so far in your recovery. Today we focus on something that will protect everything you have built: relapse prevention.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Recovery is a lifelong journey. Understanding how relapses happen allows you to prevent them. Recognizing early warning signs means you can intervene before crisis arrives.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This session is not about fear—it is about wisdom. Today you fortify your recovery. Let us begin.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== INDUCTION - Rapid Relaxation with Breathing (5-6 minutes) ===

Take a deep breath now. Diaphragmatic breathing—belly expanding as you breathe in, sinking as you breathe out.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Breathe in through your nose... belly rising gently... hold for a moment... and release through your mouth. With this exhale, your protection systems strengthen.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Another breath... deeper... and as you exhale, allow your eyes to close naturally.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let your neck become loose like rubber bands. Head floating like a helium balloon. Jaws sagging. Shoulders dropping—releasing all tension.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Arms becoming limp, loose, and heavy. All the way down to your hands.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Legs and feet the same. The better you feel, the deeper you go. The deeper you go, the stronger your protection becomes.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Your eyelids becoming wonderfully heavy. As though gently stuck together. You are ready to install protection systems.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== DEEPENING (3-4 minutes) ===

Imagine yourself at the top of a staircase... ten steps leading down to a control room where early warning systems are installed.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Ten. Stepping down. Protection forming.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Nine. Deeper. Warning systems activating.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Eight. Recovery being fortified.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Seven. Deeper still.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Six. Halfway there.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Five. So deep. So protected.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Four. Almost there.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Three. Deep protection.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Two. One more step.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

One. You step into the control room. Everything you hear will be absorbed completely.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== THERAPEUTIC CONTENT (8-10 minutes) ===

--- Relapse is a Process ---

Austin, the most important thing to understand: relapse is a process, not an event. Long before acting out, warning signs appear. There are three stages.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Think of relapse like walking toward a cliff. You do not suddenly fall—you walk toward the edge step by step. If you recognize you are heading toward danger early, you can simply change direction.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Stage One: Emotional Relapse ---

Emotional relapse is the first stage. You are not thinking about acting out, but your emotions and behaviors are setting you up.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Signs include isolation—withdrawing from people, avoiding accountability. Bottling up emotions. Poor self-care—neglecting sleep, meals, exercise. Neglecting spiritual practices.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

In emotional relapse, you are creating conditions where temptation will be strong. You are weakening your defenses without realizing it.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The intervention is simple: reach out, practice self-care, address emotions. These simple actions prevent progression.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Stage Two: Mental Relapse ---

Mental relapse is the second stage. Part of you wants to act out, and part of you does not. You are at war with yourself.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Signs include thinking about acting out. Glamorizing past use. Minimizing consequences. Bargaining—"I deserve this." Lying. Planning relapse.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The window for intervention is closing. Escalate your response. Tell your accountability partner immediately. Play the tape forward.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Stage Three: Physical Relapse ---

Physical relapse is the actual acting out. If it reaches this point, damage control is the priority.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Stop as soon as you can. A slip is not permission to binge. Reach out immediately afterward. Get back on track without delay.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

A relapse does not erase your progress. Learn from it. Rise again.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Installing Early Warning Systems ---

Let us install early warning systems in your subconscious.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

When you begin isolating, an internal alert will sound. You will recognize: I am withdrawing. This is a warning sign.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When you neglect self-care, you will notice: I am not taking care of myself. This makes me vulnerable.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When thoughts of acting out arise, you will recognize the mental relapse stage: I am in mental relapse. I need to intervene now.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

These warnings will be gentle but clear.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- HALT Revisited ---

Remember HALT. Hungry, Angry, Lonely, Tired. These are vulnerability states.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Install HALT monitoring. When you notice these states, address them before they accumulate.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Most acting out happens when multiple HALT states stack up. Do not let them.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Your Prevention Plan ---

Know in advance what you will do at each stage.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

At emotional relapse: call your accountability partner. Implement self-care. Reach out.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

At mental relapse: tell someone immediately. Remove yourself from risky situations. Use all your tools.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

At physical relapse: stop as soon as possible. Confess quickly. Get back up.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This plan is now programmed into your subconscious.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- High-Risk Situations ---

Know your personal high-risk times.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Travel, stress, celebration, boredom, late nights—these carry higher risk. Plan for them with extra vigilance.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

What situations have preceded past relapses? Those require extra protection.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Rising After a Fall ---

If you ever relapse, know this: it is not the end. The righteous man falls seven times and rises again.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Do not let shame drive you into a binge. Stop. Get up. Your next choice matters more than your last.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Anchor Reinforcement ---

Press your thumb and second finger together now.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

This anchor carries your relapse prevention programming. Early warning systems. HALT monitoring. Your prevention plan.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Whenever you sense danger, use this anchor and remember: I know the warning signs. I have a plan.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Release. The protection is installed.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

--- Scriptural Foundation ---

The Savior taught, "Watch and pray, lest ye enter into temptation." This watching is relapse prevention—vigilance without anxiety.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The Lord provides a way of escape. Your prevention plan is that way.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== POST-HYPNOTIC SUGGESTIONS (1 minute) ===

Your subconscious now holds relapse prevention programming. Early warning systems are active.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

You will automatically recognize signs of emotional and mental relapse and respond immediately.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

If you ever fall, you will rise quickly. One slip will never become a pattern.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== EMERGENCE (2-3 minutes) ===

It is time to return to full awareness, carrying your protection with you.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

I will count from one to five. With each number, you become more alert while your protection systems remain active.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

One. Beginning to return. Protection systems installed.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Two. More aware of your body. Early warning systems active.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Three. Energy returning. HALT monitoring running.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Four. Almost fully alert. Freedom safeguarded.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Five. Eyes open, fully awake, completely alert, and completely protected.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Welcome back, Austin. Your recovery is safeguarded. You know the warning signs. You have a plan.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Stay vigilant, and stay free. Intervene early. Rise if you fall. You are equipped for lasting freedom.
