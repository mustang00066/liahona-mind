[BEGIN SCRIPT]

Welcome, Austin. Today we focus on relapse prevention. You will learn to recognize warning signs early and maintain your freedom long-term.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Take a deep breath in... and release, relaxing instantly.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Another breath... and release, going deeper.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

One more breath, eyes closing, entering hypnosis now.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Allow relaxation to wash through your body quickly. Head to toe, releasing everything. Your body knows this state well. Deep relaxation achieved.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Descend now. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Deep hypnosis.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

relapse is a process, not an event. Long before acting out, warning signs appear. There is emotional relapse, then mental relapse, then physical relapse. By recognizing early stages, you can intervene before it's too late.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Emotional relapse is the first stage. You are not thinking about acting out, but your emotions and behaviors are setting you up. Signs include isolation, bottling up emotions, poor self-care, and neglecting commitments.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When you notice these signs, take action immediately. Reach out to someone. Address the emotions you are avoiding. Practice self-care. These simple interventions prevent progression.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Mental relapse is the second stage. Part of you wants to act out. Signs include thinking about acting out, glamorizing past use, minimizing consequences, and planning a relapse.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

If you find yourself in mental relapse, escalate your response. Tell your accountability partner immediately. Play the tape forward—remember how you will feel after acting out.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Physical relapse is the final stage—the actual acting out. If it reaches this point, limit the damage. Stop as soon as you can. Reach out immediately afterward. Get back on track without delay.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The Savior taught that we should watch and pray, lest we enter into temptation. This watching is relapse prevention. Vigilance without anxiety.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let us install early warning systems in your subconscious mind. When you begin isolating, an internal alert will sound. When thoughts of acting out arise, you will recognize the mental relapse stage immediately.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

These warnings will be gentle but clear. You will simply know: I am in early stage relapse. I need to take action now.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Create a relapse prevention plan. Know who you will call. Know what actions you will take at each stage. Having a plan means you don't have to think when crisis comes.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Remember HALT. Hungry, Angry, Lonely, Tired. These states increase vulnerability. Monitor them daily. Address them proactively.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

If you do relapse, it is not the end. A slip does not erase your progress. Get back up immediately. Rising is what matters.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Do not let shame after a relapse drive you into a binge. Stop, confess, learn, and recommit. Every moment is a new opportunity to choose differently.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your recovery is being protected now. The warning systems are installed. You are equipped to maintain your freedom for the rest of your life.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

See yourself years from now, still free. Freedom is your normal state.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One... beginning to return.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Two... feeling protected.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Three... becoming alert.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Four... almost fully awake.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Five... eyes open, fully alert. Your recovery is safeguarded, Austin. Stay vigilant, and stay free.
