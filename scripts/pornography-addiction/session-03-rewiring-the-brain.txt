Duration: ~34 minutes
Voice: Male, British accent, calm and compassionate

[BEGIN SCRIPT]

Welcome, Austin. Today we work directly on rewiring your brain. The neural pathways that support the addiction will be weakened, while new pathways of freedom will be strengthened.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Take a deep breath in... and release.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Another breath, preparing your mind for transformation... and release.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One more breath, and enter hypnosis now, deeply and completely.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Relax from head to toe. Let every muscle release. Your body is at peace. Your mind is open.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Descend quickly. Ten to one. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Deep hypnosis.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

your brain has formed associations. It has linked certain cues to the pleasure response that pornography provides. A bored state might trigger it. A certain device. A time of night. Stress. Loneliness. These cues automatically activate craving.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

But associations can be changed. The brain is plastic, always capable of forming new connections. Today we begin to break the old associations and form new ones.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

First, let us use a technique called covert sensitization. This creates a negative association with pornography, making it less appealing to your subconscious mind.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

In your imagination, picture yourself in a moment when you might have been tempted to view pornography. You are alone. The device is available. The old craving begins.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Now, instead of following the craving, notice how you would feel afterward. Not in the moment, but after. The guilt. The shame. The disappointment in yourself. The spiritual emptiness. The distance from God.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Feel these consequences now, before you act, not after. Let the negative feelings attach to the temptation itself. This is the truth: pornography promises pleasure but delivers pain.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Every time you think of pornography, these consequences will surface. The false promise will be exposed by the real results. Your brain is learning: this leads to suffering, not joy.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Now let us create a positive association with resistance. Picture yourself in that same tempting moment. But this time, you recognize the trigger. You pause. You choose differently.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Instead of acting out, you close the device. You leave the room. You call someone. You pray. You choose your values over the craving.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

And now feel what comes after that choice. Relief. Pride in yourself. Strength. Connection with God. Peace that passes understanding. Your self-respect intact.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Feel these positive emotions attaching to the choice of resistance. This is the truth too: resistance leads to peace, not deprivation.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your brain is now being rewired. Old pathway: craving leads to acting out, temporary pleasure, then pain. New pathway: craving leads to resistance, temporary discomfort, then lasting peace.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The new pathway is better. Your subconscious mind sees this. And it will begin to favor the better path.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Now let us address the dopamine cycle directly. Pornography creates intense dopamine spikes. The brain adapts by reducing dopamine receptors. This means you need more stimulation to feel the same pleasure. This is tolerance, the hallmark of addiction.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

As you abstain, Austin, your brain will heal. The dopamine receptors will regenerate. Normal pleasures will become pleasurable again. Food, conversation, nature, accomplishment, these will bring satisfaction that addiction had stolen.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This healing takes time. The early days and weeks are the hardest because the brain is still adapted to artificial stimulation. But every day of sobriety, healing occurs. Every day, the receptors restore.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Trust this process. The discomfort of early abstinence is temporary. The freedom that follows is permanent. You are not giving up pleasure. You are trading counterfeit pleasure for real joy.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The Savior said, whoever will save his life shall lose it; and whoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it. Letting go of the addiction feels like loss. But it is actually finding your true life.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let us create an anchor now, a physical trigger for strength and resistance. When you feel temptation arise, you will press your thumb and first finger together on your right hand. This will activate a state of strength and clarity.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Feel that state now. Strong. Clear. In control. Connected to God. Above the craving. You have power over this.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Press your thumb and finger together now, feeling this state of power. Hold it. Let the association form.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Release. The anchor is set. Whenever temptation strikes, this gesture will bring strength.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Now visualize your future brain. See the old pathways fading, like unused roads becoming overgrown. See the new pathways strengthening, like highways being built. Your brain is physically changing. Neural architecture is being rebuilt.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

In weeks and months, the craving will weaken. The triggers will lose their power. The addiction will become a memory rather than a current struggle. This is not wishful thinking. This is how brain change works.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You are not white-knuckling through willpower alone. You are systematically rewiring your brain. You are supported by the techniques of science and the power of God. This combination is unstoppable.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Continue to practice the techniques you are learning. Each time you resist, the resistance pathway strengthens. Each day of sobriety, the receptors heal. Time is on your side. Keep going.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let all of this programming settle into your subconscious now. The old associations weakening. The new associations strengthening. The anchor installed. The brain healing.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

It is time to return now.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

One... beginning to return, brain rewiring.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Two... feeling stronger.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Three... becoming alert.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Four... almost fully awake.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Five... eyes open. Your brain is changing, Austin. Every day, you become freer.
