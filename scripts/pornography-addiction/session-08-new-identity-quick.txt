Duration: ~28 minutes
Voice: Male, British accent, calm and compassionate

[BEGIN SCRIPT]

Welcome, Austin. Today we focus on identity transformation. You are not just stopping a behavior. You are becoming someone for whom this addiction is foreign.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Take a deep breath in... and release.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Another breath, connecting to who you are becoming... and release.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One more breath... eyes closing, entering transformation.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Relax completely. Peace filling every part of you.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Descend now. Ten to one. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Deep hypnosis.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

identity drives behavior. If you see yourself as someone who simply does not use pornography or compulsively masturbate, freedom becomes natural.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You are transitioning from someone who fights to someone for whom these behaviors are simply not options. Genuine identity change.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

In the gospel, this is becoming a new creature in Christ. The old man put off, the new man put on.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Who are you becoming? A man of integrity. Private life matches public. Nothing to hide.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

A man of self-mastery. Your appetites do not control you.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

A man of connection. Real relationships over counterfeit intimacy. People over pixels.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

A man of faith. Relying on the Savior. An instrument in His hands.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Step into this future Austin. He wakes with purpose. Encounters triggers but they barely register. He is no longer that person.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Present in relationships. Clear conscience at night. Whole and integrated. This is freedom.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This future is emerging. With every session, every day of sobriety, he becomes more real. You are already becoming him.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The Savior said, Ye must be born again. You are being born again. The old self dying. The new self rising.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When temptation comes, respond: I am not someone who does that. Mean it. And it will be true.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One... beginning to return.
Two... carrying your new identity.
Three... becoming alert.
Four... refreshed.
Five... eyes open, fully alert. You are a new creation, Austin. Live like it.
