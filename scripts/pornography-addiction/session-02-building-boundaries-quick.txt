[BEGIN SCRIPT]

Welcome back, Austin. Today we build boundaries—protective walls that keep you safe from temptation.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Take a deep breath in... and release.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Another breath, deeper... preparing for protection.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One more breath... eyes closing, entering safety.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let relaxation flow through you. Head to toe. Complete peace.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Descend now. Ten to one. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Deep hypnosis.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Recovery requires boundaries—limits you establish to protect yourself.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Three circles: Red circle—off-limits behaviors: pornography, masturbation to fantasy. Yellow circle—warning signs: alone with devices late at night, browsing aimlessly. Green circle—safe zone: healthy activities, connection, exercise.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Practical boundaries: filters on devices, shared passwords, no devices in bedrooms, no private internet late at night.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When urges to masturbate arise, recognize you are entering yellow zone. Leave the private space, reach out, engage in activity.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The scripture teaches, Watch and pray. Boundaries are how you watch.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

See yourself living within boundaries. Filters active. Accountability strong. You stay in the green circle. Safety surrounds you.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

These are protective walls around a garden. Inside them, you grow freely.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Commit now to establishing and honoring your boundaries.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One... beginning to return.
Two... protected and prepared.
Three... becoming alert.
Four... refreshed.
Five... eyes open, fully alert. Build your boundaries today, Austin.
