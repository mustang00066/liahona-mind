=== PRE-TALK / SETTLING (1-2 minutes) ===

Welcome back, Austin. You are continuing your journey toward freedom. In our first session, you learned about the nature of addiction and why freedom is possible. Today we build something essential: boundaries.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Think of boundaries as the walls of a fortress. They are not meant to imprison you—they are meant to protect you. Inside the fortress you are free. The walls simply keep the enemy out.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Today you will learn the three circles model, establish practical device boundaries, and install an automatic response that activates whenever you approach danger. Let us begin.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== INDUCTION - Rapid Relaxation with Breathing (5-6 minutes) ===

Take a deep breath now. Diaphragmatic breathing—belly expanding as you breathe in, sinking as you breathe out.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Breathe in through your nose... belly rising... hold gently... and release through your mouth. With this exhale, your boundaries begin to form.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Another breath... deeper... and as you exhale, allow your eyes to close naturally.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let your neck become loose like rubber bands. Head floating like a helium balloon. Jaws sagging. Shoulders dropping completely.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Arms becoming limp, loose, and heavy. All the way down to your hands.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Legs and feet the same. The better you feel, the deeper you go.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Your eyelids becoming wonderfully heavy. As though gently stuck together. Protection is being installed.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== DEEPENING (3-4 minutes) ===

Imagine yourself at the top of a staircase... ten steps leading down to a place where boundaries are built.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Ten. Stepping down. Protection deepening.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Nine. Deeper. Fortress walls rising.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Eight. More peaceful. Boundaries forming.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Seven. Safe and held.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Six. Halfway there.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Five. The deeper you go, the stronger your boundaries.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Four. Almost there.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Three. Deep peace.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Two. One more step.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

One. You arrive at the boundary workshop. Ready to build protection that will last.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== THERAPEUTIC CONTENT (8-10 minutes) ===

--- The Three Circles Model ---

Austin, imagine three concentric circles, like a target.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The outermost circle is green—your safe zone. Everything here supports your recovery: healthy connection, exercise, prayer, productive work, time with family.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The middle circle is yellow—your warning zone. Situations here move you toward danger: being alone with devices late at night, browsing aimlessly, skipping accountability, the HALT states.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The innermost circle is red—your acting out zone. Everything here is off-limits: pornography, masturbation to fantasy or pornographic imagery, seeking sexual content.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your goal is to stay in the green circle. When you drift toward yellow, take immediate action to move back to safety.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- The Red Circle ---

In your red circle, place behaviors that are absolutely off-limits.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Pornography in any form. This is red.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Masturbation to fantasy or pornographic memory. This is red.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Seeking sexually arousing content of any kind. This is red.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

These are not punishments—they are protection. They keep you safe from behaviors that have caused pain.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

--- The Yellow Circle ---

In your yellow circle, place warning signs.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Being alone with unrestricted internet, especially late at night. This is yellow.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Browsing without purpose. Skipping accountability. Allowing HALT states to build. Entertaining fantasy. These are yellow.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When you find yourself in yellow, your internal alarm sounds. This is prevention mode—take action before crisis.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

--- The Green Circle ---

Your green circle contains everything that supports recovery.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Connection with family and friends. Exercise. Prayer and scripture. Productive work. Accountability check-ins. Rest and self-care. Hobbies and service.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Fill your life with green circle activities until there is no room for destructive patterns.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Practical Device Boundaries ---

Now establish practical boundaries around technology.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

First: Install filters on every device. Covenant Eyes, Net Nanny, or similar. These create barriers and alert accountability partners.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Second: Share passwords with spouse or accountability partner. Secrecy feeds addiction.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Third: No devices in bedrooms or bathrooms. Keep technology in common areas.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Fourth: No private internet after a set hour—perhaps 9 PM. Late night is when willpower is lowest.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Fifth: Purpose before use. Ask "What am I trying to accomplish?" before picking up any device.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

These are not prison walls—they are fortress walls. Inside them, you are free.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- The Boundary Response ---

Let us install an automatic response for when you approach the yellow circle.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

When you notice a warning sign, your response activates automatically.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

First: Stop. Pause whatever you are doing.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Second: Assess. What is happening? Which HALT factor is active?

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Third: Redirect. Put down the device. Leave the private space. Call someone. Move your body.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Fourth: Address the need. If hungry, eat. If angry, express it. If lonely, connect. If tired, rest.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Stop, assess, redirect, address. This becomes automatic.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Anchor Reinforcement ---

Press your thumb and second finger together now.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

This anchor now carries your boundaries. The three circles. The device boundaries. The boundary response.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Whenever you need protection, use this anchor and instantly remember: I have boundaries. I know what to do.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Release. The protection is installed.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

--- Scripture Foundation ---

The Savior taught: Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Boundaries are how you watch. They keep you from entering situations where your defenses weaken. This is wisdom, not weakness.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The Lord does not ask you to stand in fire and resist burning. He invites you to stay out of the fire. Boundaries keep you out.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== POST-HYPNOTIC SUGGESTIONS (1 minute) ===

Your subconscious now holds these boundaries. The three circles are clear. The device boundaries are installed. The response is automatic.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

You will naturally maintain your boundaries. They will feel protective, not restrictive.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

When temptation arises, your fortress walls will hold. You remain safely in your green circle.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== EMERGENCE (2-3 minutes) ===

It is time to return to full awareness, carrying your boundaries with you.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

I will count from one to five. With each number, you become more alert while your boundaries become more solid.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

One. Beginning to return. Boundaries coming with you.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Two. More aware of your body. The three circles clear in your mind.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Three. Energy returning. Device boundaries installed.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Four. Almost fully alert. The boundary response automatic.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Five. Eyes open, fully awake, completely alert, and fully protected.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Welcome back, Austin. You have built boundaries that will protect you day after day.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Now the practical work begins. Install the filters. Share the passwords. Move the devices. The inner work you did here prepares you for the outer work you will do today. Build your fortress. Freedom awaits.
