### 2. INDUCTION (10-12 minutes, ~1,200 words)
**Purpose:** Guide into trance state, bypass critical faculty

**Choose ONE primary technique, layer with secondary:**

#### Option A: Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR)
- Start at top of head OR feet (traditionally head-down)
- Work through EVERY major muscle group with detailed attention
- Include: scalp, forehead, eyes, jaw, neck, shoulders, upper arms, forearms, hands, fingers, chest, stomach, lower back, hips, thighs, knees, calves, ankles, feet, toes
- Use "tense and release" OR "warm light spreading" metaphor
- Pacing: Each body area gets 15-20 seconds of attention

#### Option B: Breathing-Focused Induction
- 4-7-8 breathing pattern
- Count breaths (10 down to 1)
- Associate exhale with releasing tension
- "With each breath, going deeper..."

#### Option C: Eye Fixation + Closure
- Focus on a point (candle flame, spot on ceiling)
- Describe heaviness of eyelids
- Count down as eyes close naturally
- Transition to internal focus

#### Option D: Visualization-Based
- Safe place imagery from the start
- Detailed sensory engagement (see, hear, feel, smell)
- Natural deepening through the scene

**Layering:** Combine breathing suggestions throughout ANY induction type.

**Key Phrases:**
- "That's right..."
- "You're doing perfectly..."
- "Allow yourself to..."
- "Notice how..."
- "Deeper and deeper..."
- "More and more relaxed..."

**Pause Pattern:**
```
[Instruction/suggestion - 20-30 seconds]
[PAUSE 4-5 SECONDS]
[Next instruction - 20-30 seconds]
[PAUSE 4-5 SECONDS]
```

---

### 3. DEEPENING (8-10 minutes, ~900-1,100 words)
**Purpose:** Achieve optimal trance depth for suggestion work

**Use 2-3 deepening techniques in sequence:**

#### Technique 1: Staircase/Elevator Descent
- 20, 15, or 10 steps/floors
- Each step = deeper relaxation
- Describe the environment (marble stairs, soft carpet, golden light)
- Number slowly with suggestions between

```
Twenty... stepping down, going deeper...
[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]
Nineteen... more relaxed with every step...
[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]
```

#### Technique 2: Counting Down
- Count from 10 to 1 (or 5 to 1)
- Doubling relaxation with each number
- "With each number, twice as relaxed as before..."

#### Technique 3: Safe Place Elaboration
- Expand the safe place visualization
- Add sensory details progressively
- Anchor the feeling of safety

#### Technique 4: Fractionation
- "In a moment, I'll ask you to open your eyes briefly..."
- Brief eye opening (3-5 seconds)
- Close again, go twice as deep
- Repeat 2-3 times

#### Technique 5: Body Scan Deepener
- Quick scan from head to toe
- Notice and release any remaining tension
- Confirm total relaxation

**Depth Testing Phrases:**
- "Notice how deeply relaxed you've become..."
- "Your subconscious mind is now fully open and receptive..."
- "You're in the perfect state for positive change..."

### 4. THERAPEUTIC CONTENT (15-18 minutes, ~1,800-2,200 words)

#### 4B. Root Cause Exploration (2-3 min)
- Gentle exploration of when pattern started
- Understanding the positive intention behind the behavior
- Permission to release old patterns
- "Your subconscious was trying to protect/help you..."

#### 4C. Core Therapeutic Metaphor (4-5 min)
- Extended metaphor relevant to the issue
- **Anxiety:** Storm passing, anchor in the harbor, mountain stream
- **Phone Addiction:** Breaking chains, reclaiming your garden, turning off the noise machine
- **Confidence:** Diamond covered in mud, emerging butterfly, standing tall as a tree
