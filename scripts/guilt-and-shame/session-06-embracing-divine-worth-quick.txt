=== PRE-TALK / SETTLING (1-2 minutes) ===

Welcome back, Austin. Today we build something unshakeable: a deep understanding of your divine worth.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Shame says your worth depends on your performance. This is a lie. The truth is that your worth was established before you did anything to earn it.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You are a child of God. When you truly understand this, shame loses its power forever. Let us begin.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== INDUCTION - Rapid Relaxation with Breathing (5-6 minutes) ===

Take a deep breath now. Diaphragmatic breathing—belly expanding as you breathe in, sinking as you breathe out.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Breathe in through your nose... belly rising gently... hold for a moment... and release through your mouth. With this exhale, open yourself to truth about who you really are.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Another breath... deeper... and as you exhale, allow your eyes to close naturally.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let your neck become loose like rubber bands. Head floating like a helium balloon. Jaws sagging. Shoulders dropping—releasing all tension.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Arms becoming limp, loose, and heavy. All the way down to your hands.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Legs and feet the same. The better you feel, the deeper you go. Entering a sacred space where truth can be received.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Your eyelids becoming wonderfully heavy. As though gently stuck together. You are ready for divine truth.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== DEEPENING (3-4 minutes) ===

Imagine yourself at the top of a staircase... ten steps leading down to a temple of truth where your divine identity is revealed.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Ten. Stepping down. Approaching sacred truth.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Nine. Deeper. The world's lies about your worth fading.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Eight. Divine truth becoming accessible.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Seven. Deeper still.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Six. Halfway there.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Five. So deep. So beloved.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Four. Almost there.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Three. Deep sacred truth.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Two. One more step.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

One. You step into the temple of truth. Light surrounds you. Here, you understand who you really are.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== THERAPEUTIC CONTENT (8-10 minutes) ===

Receive only what serves you. Your subconscious mind will accept what is true for you and let the rest go.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

--- Your Divine Origin ---

Before this world was created, Austin, you existed. A child of Heavenly Parents. A spirit with personality, potential, and worth.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your worth was established then. It was given to you as a birthright. Nothing you have done or will ever do can change that foundational worth.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This is not something you must earn. It is not something you can lose. It simply is.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- What the Atonement Says About Your Worth ---

Consider the Atonement. Jesus Christ gave His life for you.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Why would He do that for someone worthless? He would not. He did it because you are infinitely valuable to Him.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The cross says: "You are worth dying for." You are not worthless. You are priceless.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Identity Beyond Behavior ---

You are not defined by your worst moments. You are not your failures or sins.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

These are things you have done. They are not who you are.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Who you are is a son of God. This is your identity—prior to your behavior, deeper than your mistakes.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When shame says, "You're worthless," you can reply: "I am a child of God. My worth is not in question."

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Receiving Divine Love ---

Allow yourself to feel God's love for you now.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

He loves you on your worst day exactly as much as on your best day. His love is not earned or lost. It simply is.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Imagine His love as warm, golden light surrounding you, filling every cell of your being.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You are loved. You are cherished. You are His.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Anchor Reinforcement ---

Place your palm on your chest now.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

This anchor carries the truth of your divine worth.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Say internally: "I am a child of God. My worth is inherent. I am loved beyond measure."

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When shame attacks, use this anchor and remember who you really are.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Release your hand.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== POST-HYPNOTIC SUGGESTIONS (1 minute) ===

Your worth is inherent, not earned. You are a child of God. This is your true identity.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When shame attacks, your anchor will activate. You will remember who you really are and shame will lose its power.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== EMERGENCE (2-3 minutes) ===

It is time to return to full awareness, bringing your divine identity with you.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

I will count from one to five. With each number, you become more alert while your worth remains secure.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

One. Beginning to return. Divine worth established.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Two. Energy returning. Beloved.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Three. Your identity is secure.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Four. Almost fully alert. Filled with light.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Five. Eyes open, fully awake, completely alert, and knowing who you really are.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Welcome back, Austin. You have touched something sacred today.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

You are a child of God. Your worth is not in question. You are loved unconditionally.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Live from this truth. You are His. You are loved. You are priceless.
