=== PRE-TALK / SETTLING (1-2 minutes) ===

Welcome back, Austin. Today we go to the source. Today we heal childhood shame.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Much of the shame we carry as adults was planted in childhood. Young minds are vulnerable. Messages and experiences can create deep beliefs about our worth that we carry for decades.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You are an adult now with resources that child did not have. You can go back with compassion and give that child what they needed. This is powerful healing work. Let us begin.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== INDUCTION - Rapid Relaxation with Breathing (5-6 minutes) ===

Take a deep breath now. Diaphragmatic breathing—belly expanding as you breathe in, sinking as you breathe out.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Breathe in through your nose... belly rising gently... hold for a moment... and release through your mouth. With this exhale, create safety. The adult you is here to protect the child you.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Another breath... deeper... and as you exhale, allow your eyes to close naturally.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let your neck become loose like rubber bands. Head floating like a helium balloon. Jaws sagging. Shoulders dropping—releasing all tension.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Arms becoming limp, loose, and heavy. All the way down to your hands.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Legs and feet the same. The better you feel, the deeper you go. Compassion growing in your heart for the child you once were.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Your eyelids becoming wonderfully heavy. As though gently stuck together. You are ready to bring healing.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== DEEPENING (3-4 minutes) ===

Imagine yourself at the top of a staircase... ten steps leading down through time—back to childhood.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Ten. Stepping down. Beginning the journey backward.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Nine. Deeper. Compassion growing.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Eight. The past becoming accessible.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Seven. Deeper still.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Six. Halfway there.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Five. So deep. Ready to heal.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Four. Almost there.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Three. Deep healing possible.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Two. One more step.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

One. You step into a scene from childhood. You see yourself as a young boy. The adult you is here to bring healing.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== THERAPEUTIC CONTENT (8-10 minutes) ===

Receive only what serves you. Your subconscious mind will accept what is true for you and let the rest go.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

--- Meeting Your Younger Self ---

Look at the child before you. This is you—young, vulnerable, trying to navigate a confusing world.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Notice what age this child appears to be. Your subconscious knows what age most needs healing today.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This child did not deserve to feel shame. No child does. Shame was learned through experiences that were never about his worth.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Speaking Truth to the Child ---

Approach the child. Kneel down so you are at eye level. Take his hand.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Now speak to this child. Speak the words he needed to hear then:

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

"I know what happened hurt you. But you are not bad. You were never bad. You were a child doing your best."

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

"The things that happened were not your fault. The harsh words, the rejection—they were not about you."

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

"You are worthy of love. You always have been. There is nothing wrong with you. You are good."

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Watch the child's face as he receives these words. Perhaps you see relief. Perhaps tears.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Tell him: "I am you, grown up. I survived. You are going to be okay. You are going to learn that you are worthy."

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Releasing the Shame ---

Imagine the shame as a heavy cloak wrapped around this child's shoulders. It was put there by circumstances, by false beliefs.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Together, lift this cloak off his shoulders. Feel its weight.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Now, drop it. Watch it fall to the ground. It was never his to wear. It never told the truth about who he was.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Without the cloak, the child stands taller. Lighter. Freer.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Integration ---

This child is part of you. Invite him to come with you—to be integrated into who you are now.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Place your hand over your heart. Feel the child settling there, safe and loved. He is home. He is part of you. And he is free.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Anchor Reinforcement ---

Place your palm on your chest now.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Feel the warmth spreading. This is self-compassion that extends to every age you have ever been.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Say internally: "I am not my childhood shame. I am a child of God. My worth was established before any of it happened."

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Release your hand.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== POST-HYPNOTIC SUGGESTIONS (1 minute) ===

The child within has heard the truth and received the love he needed. This healing will continue to unfold.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

When old shame surfaces, you will recognize it as an old message—not the truth about who you are now.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The cloak of shame has been removed. You walk lighter, freer, more aware of your worth.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== EMERGENCE (2-3 minutes) ===

It is time to return to full awareness, bringing the healing with you.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

I will count from one to five. With each number, you become more alert while the healing remains.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

One. Beginning to return. The child is at peace in your heart.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Two. Energy returning. Lighter now.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Three. The shame cloak is gone forever.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Four. Almost fully alert. Gratitude for this healing.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Five. Eyes open, fully awake, completely alert, and healed at the deepest level.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Welcome back, Austin. You have done profound healing work today.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

The child within has heard the truth. The cloak of shame is removed. He walks with you now, free and whole.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Be gentle with yourself. This healing will continue to unfold.
