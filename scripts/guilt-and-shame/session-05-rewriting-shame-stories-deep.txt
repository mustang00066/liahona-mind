=== PRE-TALK / SETTLING (2-3 minutes) ===

Welcome back, Austin. You have done significant healing work—understanding shame, identifying triggers, healing childhood wounds, and developing self-compassion. Today we address something powerful: the stories you tell yourself.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

We all carry stories about who we are. These stories were written by experiences, by others' words, by our own interpretations of events. And many of these stories are shame stories—narratives that say we are fundamentally flawed, broken, or unworthy.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The good news is that stories can be rewritten. You are the author of your life's meaning. Today, you will learn to identify the shame stories you have been telling yourself and replace them with stories that are true, empowering, and aligned with your divine worth.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This is not about denial or pretending bad things did not happen. It is about choosing how you interpret those events and what they mean about you.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Find a comfortable position. Allow your body to settle. Today you become the author of your own story. Let us begin.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== INDUCTION - Eye Fatigue with Diaphragmatic Breathing (10-12 minutes) ===

Begin by finding a spot on the ceiling or wall, slightly above your natural line of sight. A spot that requires you to look upward without straining your neck.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Focus on that spot. Keep your eyes fixed there as you begin to breathe deeply. Diaphragmatic breathing—belly expanding as you breathe in, sinking as you breathe out.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Breathe in through your nose... belly rising gently... hold for a moment... and release through your mouth. With this exhale, release the old stories. New stories are waiting to be written.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Continue gazing at that spot. Notice how your eyes begin to feel. A slight strain. A heaviness developing. This is natural and welcome. With each breath, this heaviness increases.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Another breath now... deeper than before... belly expanding... hold... and release. Your mind is opening to new possibilities, new interpretations, new truth.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Keep your eyes on that spot. They are growing heavier. The muscles around your eyes are tiring. Some of you may notice a watering of the eyes. Others feel a pulling sensation. Both are signs that hypnosis is developing.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Breathe in once more... letting the breath fill your entire chest cavity... hold... and as you exhale, notice your eyes wanting to close. When the desire becomes strong enough, allow them to close naturally.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

If your eyes have not yet closed, take another breath and let them close with the exhale. There is no rush. Your eyes will close when they are ready.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Eyes now closed... feel the relief. In this creative, open state, you have access to the deeper parts of your mind where stories are stored. Here, you can rewrite them.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Now that your eyes are closed, bring your attention to your breathing. Allow each breath to deepen the relaxation flowing through your body.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

With your next breath, focus on your scalp. Feel it softening, relaxing. Any tension held there simply melting away. Warmth spreading across the top of your head.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

This warmth flows down to your forehead. Feel the muscles of your forehead smoothing out. All worry lines dissolving. Your forehead becoming cool, calm, completely relaxed.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Down to your eyes now—those tired muscles resting deeply. Your eyelids becoming wonderfully heavy.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The relaxation spreads to your cheeks and jaw. Your jaw becoming slack. Your teeth parting slightly.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Down into your neck. Feel each vertebra of your neck relaxing. The muscles on the sides and back of your neck becoming loose like warm rubber.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The wave of relaxation flows into your shoulders. Feel yours dropping now. Releasing their load. Becoming soft and heavy.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Down through your arms. The relaxation flowing like warm honey through your upper arms... your elbows... your forearms. Into your wrists and hands. Each finger becoming loose and heavy.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Your chest now. Feel your breathing becoming even slower, even deeper. Your heart beating calmly, steadily.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The warmth spreads through your stomach. Any knots or butterflies dissolving completely.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Into your lower back. Feel it softening. The muscles along your spine releasing their grip.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Through your hips now, releasing any tightness. Down into your thighs. Your large leg muscles becoming completely limp, loose, and heavy.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Past your knees, into your calves. Resting now. Completely at peace.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Into your ankles, your feet, your toes. Every muscle, every joint, every cell bathed in deep relaxation.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

You are deeply relaxed, Austin. Your body is at peace. Your mind is creative and open. Ready to rewrite your story.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== DEEPENING - 20-Step Staircase (8-10 minutes) ===

In your mind's eye, you find yourself at the top of a beautiful staircase. This staircase has twenty steps, and it leads down to a library—your personal library of stories about yourself.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The banister is smooth beneath your hand. The steps are solid and safe. With each step you descend, you will go deeper into hypnosis and gain more power to rewrite your narratives.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Step twenty. Taking the first step down. Feeling relaxation deepen. Creativity awakening.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step nineteen. Going deeper. Old stories loosening their grip.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step eighteen. Deeper still. Your author's voice growing stronger.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step seventeen. Every step takes you deeper. Every step brings more freedom.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step sixteen. Mind quieting. New possibilities emerging.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step fifteen. Halfway there. So relaxed. So creative.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step fourteen. Deeper than before. Shame stories ready to be rewritten.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step thirteen. Feeling profoundly at peace.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step twelve. Your power to choose meaning is expanding.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step eleven. So comfortable. So open.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step ten. Entering the deepest levels now. The library is near.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step nine. Everything you write here becomes part of you.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step eight. Going deeper still.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step seven. Profound creative power developing.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step six. Almost there, Austin.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step five. So deep now. Completely ready to rewrite.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step four. Deeper than you have ever been.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step three. The library door is just ahead.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step two. One more step.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step one. You step into your personal library. Shelves line the walls, filled with the stories you have told yourself about who you are. Here, you have the power to pull out old shame stories and write new ones.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== THERAPEUTIC CONTENT (15-18 minutes) ===

--- Identifying Your Shame Stories ---

Look around this library. On these shelves are the stories you have absorbed about yourself. Some are true. Some are partially true. And some are complete lies that shame wrote.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let your subconscious guide you to a shelf that holds a shame story—a narrative about yourself that has caused pain and limited your life.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Perhaps the story says: "I am a failure."

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Perhaps it says: "I am unlovable."

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Perhaps it says: "I am weak."

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Perhaps it says: "I will never change."

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Perhaps it says: "I am fundamentally broken."

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

What is the shame story you have been telling yourself? Let it come into awareness now.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Pull this book from the shelf. Feel its weight. This story has been heavy to carry.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Open it and read the first line. What does it say about you? What conclusion does it draw? Notice how it makes you feel when you read it.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Questioning the Story ---

Now let us examine this story. Is it true? Is it completely true? Or has shame exaggerated, distorted, and lied?

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Ask yourself: Where did this story come from? Who first told me this about myself? Was it a parent's critical voice? A peer's rejection? My own interpretation of painful events?

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Ask yourself: Is this story based on facts, or on feelings? Shame feels true, but feelings are not facts. Just because you felt unlovable does not mean you are unlovable.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Ask yourself: What evidence contradicts this story? Are there times when the opposite was true? Have you succeeded despite the "failure" story? Have you been loved despite the "unlovable" story?

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Ask yourself: What would someone who loves me say about this story? Would they agree with it, or would they see you differently?

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The shame story is not the whole truth. It is a distorted narrative written by pain. And you can rewrite it.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Rewriting Your Story ---

Now, in this library, you hold the power to rewrite. You are the author.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Take the shame story and set it aside. Take a new, blank book from the shelf. This is where you will write a truer story.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

What is a more accurate, more complete, more compassionate story about yourself?

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

If the old story said "I am a failure," perhaps the new story says: "I have failed at times, and I have also succeeded. Failure is how I learn. I am someone who keeps trying."

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

If the old story said "I am unlovable," perhaps the new story says: "I have been rejected at times, and I have also been loved. I am worthy of love, and I am learning to love myself."

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

If the old story said "I am weak," perhaps the new story says: "I have struggled with weakness, and I have also shown strength. I am human, growing stronger every day."

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

If the old story said "I will never change," perhaps the new story says: "I have fallen many times, and I have also risen. Change is happening, even when I cannot see it."

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Write your new story now. What is the truer, kinder, more accurate narrative about who you are?

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let the words flow from your heart onto the page. This is your story. You are the author. Write something worthy of who you really are.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Installing the New Story ---

Read your new story. Feel how different it is from the old one. It does not deny the hard things, but it does not let them define you. It is honest, compassionate, and empowering.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Now, place this new book on the shelf—in front of the old shame story. The new story takes priority. Whenever your mind reaches for a narrative about yourself, it will find the new story first.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The old story is not destroyed—you cannot erase the past. But it is no longer the primary narrative. It fades to the back while the new story moves forward.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- The Power of Narrative ---

Austin, the stories we tell ourselves shape our reality. If you believe you are a failure, you act like one. If you believe you are growing, you grow.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This is not mere positive thinking. This is about aligning your story with truth—the truth that you are a child of God, that your worth is inherent, that your potential is real.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The Savior is a master storyteller. He tells you a story in which you are the lost sheep worth leaving the ninety-nine for. You are the prodigal son welcomed home with a feast. You are the sinner made clean, the broken made whole.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

His story about you is the truest story. Let it become your story.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Anchor Reinforcement ---

Place your palm on your chest now.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Feel the warmth spreading. This anchor now carries your new story. When you use it, you access the true narrative about who you are.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Say internally: "I am the author of my story. I choose meaning. I choose truth. I am not defined by shame."

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

This anchor is a gateway to your new narrative.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Release your hand.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== POST-HYPNOTIC SUGGESTIONS (2-3 minutes) ===

Let these new patterns sink deep into your subconscious mind now.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When shame stories arise, you will recognize them as old narratives—not truth. You will question them and replace them with your new story.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your new story is installed and growing stronger. It takes priority over the old shame narratives.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You are the author of your life's meaning. You choose how to interpret your experiences. You choose what they mean about you.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your identity is aligned with truth—that you are a child of God, loved, valuable, and capable of change.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

These new narratives are permanent and will continue to strengthen.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== EMERGENCE (3-5 minutes) ===

It is time to return to full waking consciousness, bringing your new story with you.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

In a moment, I will count from one to ten. With each number, you will become more alert, more awake, while your new narratives remain primary.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One. Beginning the journey back. New stories installed.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Two. Feeling energy returning to your body. Author's power active.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Three. The old shame stories fading.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Four. Your mind clearing. Your new narrative taking hold.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Five. Halfway back now. Feeling empowered to write your story.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Six. More alert with each breath. Truth replacing lies.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Seven. Almost there. Ready to live your new story.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Eight. Eyes preparing to open. Creativity flowing.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Nine. Nearly fully awake. Taking a deep, refreshing breath.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Ten. Eyes open, fully alert, completely refreshed, and living your new story.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Welcome back, Austin. You have done transformative work today.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

You have identified a shame story and rewritten it with truth. The new story is installed. When your mind reaches for a narrative about yourself, it will find the empowering version first.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Continue this work. When you notice shame stories arising, question them and rewrite them. You are the author. You choose the meaning.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Your new story is waiting to be lived.
