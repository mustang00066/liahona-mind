=== PRE-TALK / SETTLING (1-2 minutes) ===

Welcome back, Austin. Today we address something powerful: the stories you tell yourself.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

We all carry stories about who we are. Many of these are shame stories—narratives that say we are fundamentally flawed or unworthy.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

But stories can be rewritten. You are the author of your life's meaning. Today you learn to replace shame stories with truth. Let us begin.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== INDUCTION - Rapid Relaxation with Breathing (5-6 minutes) ===

Take a deep breath now. Diaphragmatic breathing—belly expanding as you breathe in, sinking as you breathe out.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Breathe in through your nose... belly rising gently... hold for a moment... and release through your mouth. With this exhale, release the old stories. New stories are waiting.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Another breath... deeper... and as you exhale, allow your eyes to close naturally.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let your neck become loose like rubber bands. Head floating like a helium balloon. Jaws sagging. Shoulders dropping—releasing all tension.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Arms becoming limp, loose, and heavy. All the way down to your hands.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Legs and feet the same. The better you feel, the deeper you go. Your mind opening to new possibilities.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Your eyelids becoming wonderfully heavy. As though gently stuck together. You are ready to rewrite.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== DEEPENING (3-4 minutes) ===

Imagine yourself at the top of a staircase... ten steps leading down to a library—your personal library of stories about yourself.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Ten. Stepping down. Creativity awakening.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Nine. Deeper. Old stories loosening their grip.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Eight. Your author's voice growing stronger.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Seven. Deeper still.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Six. Halfway there.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Five. So deep. So creative.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Four. Almost there.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Three. Deep creative power.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Two. One more step.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

One. You enter your personal library. Shelves filled with stories about who you are. Here, you can rewrite them.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== THERAPEUTIC CONTENT (8-10 minutes) ===

Receive only what serves you. Your subconscious mind will accept what is true for you and let the rest go.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

--- Identifying Your Shame Story ---

Look around this library. Let your subconscious guide you to a shelf holding a shame story—a narrative that has caused pain.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Perhaps it says: "I am a failure." Or "I am unlovable." Or "I will never change." What is your shame story?

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Pull this book from the shelf. Feel its weight. This story has been heavy to carry.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Read the first line. What does it say about you? Notice how it makes you feel.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Questioning the Story ---

Is this story completely true? Or has shame exaggerated and distorted?

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Where did this story come from? Who first told you this about yourself?

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

What evidence contradicts this story? Have there been times when the opposite was true?

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The shame story is not the whole truth. It is a distorted narrative written by pain. And you can rewrite it.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Rewriting Your Story ---

Set the shame story aside. Take a new, blank book from the shelf.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

What is a more accurate, compassionate story about yourself?

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

If the old story said "I am a failure," perhaps the new story says: "I have failed at times, and I have also succeeded. I am someone who keeps trying."

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

If the old story said "I am unlovable," perhaps the new story says: "I have been rejected at times, and I have also been loved. I am worthy of love."

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Write your new story now. Let the words flow from your heart.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Installing the New Story ---

Place this new book on the shelf—in front of the old shame story. The new story takes priority.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Whenever your mind reaches for a narrative about yourself, it will find the new story first.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The Savior tells you a story in which you are the lost sheep worth leaving the ninety-nine for. His story about you is the truest story.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Anchor Reinforcement ---

Place your palm on your chest now.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Feel the warmth spreading. This anchor now carries your new story.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Say internally: "I am the author of my story. I choose truth. I am not defined by shame."

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Release your hand.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== POST-HYPNOTIC SUGGESTIONS (1 minute) ===

When shame stories arise, you will recognize them as old narratives—not truth. You will replace them with your new story.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You are the author of your life's meaning. Your identity aligns with truth—that you are a child of God, loved and valuable.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== EMERGENCE (2-3 minutes) ===

It is time to return to full awareness, bringing your new story with you.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

I will count from one to five. With each number, you become more alert while your new narrative remains primary.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

One. Beginning to return. New stories installed.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Two. Energy returning. Author's power active.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Three. The old shame stories fading.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Four. Almost fully alert. Ready to live your new story.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Five. Eyes open, fully awake, completely alert, and living your new story.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Welcome back, Austin. You have done transformative work today.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

You have rewritten a shame story with truth. When shame narratives arise, question them and rewrite them.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

You are the author. Your new story is waiting to be lived.
