=== PRE-TALK / SETTLING (2-3 minutes) ===

Welcome back, Austin. You have learned to distinguish guilt from shame and to identify your triggers. Today we go to the source. Today we heal childhood shame.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Much of the shame we carry as adults was planted in childhood. Young minds are vulnerable. Messages from parents, teachers, peers, and experiences can create deep beliefs about our worth that we carry for decades.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This session is not about blaming anyone. Parents usually did the best they could with what they had. What matters now is healing the young parts of you that still carry shame from long ago.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You are an adult now. You have resources that child did not have. You can go back with compassion and give that child what they needed then. This is powerful healing work.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You may feel emotion during this session. That is welcome. Tears are healing. Whatever arises, your anchor is ready. Let us begin.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== INDUCTION - Eye Fatigue with Diaphragmatic Breathing (10-12 minutes) ===

Begin by finding a spot on the ceiling or wall, slightly above your natural line of sight. A spot that requires you to look upward without straining your neck.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Focus on that spot. Keep your eyes fixed there as you begin to breathe deeply. Diaphragmatic breathing—belly expanding as you breathe in, sinking as you breathe out.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Breathe in through your nose... belly rising gently... hold for a moment... and release through your mouth. With this exhale, create safety. The adult you is here to protect the child you.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Continue gazing at that spot. Notice how your eyes begin to feel. A slight strain. A heaviness developing. This is natural and welcome. With each breath, this heaviness increases.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Another breath now... deeper than before... belly expanding... hold... and release. Feel compassion growing in your heart for the child you once were.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Keep your eyes on that spot. They are growing heavier. The muscles around your eyes are tiring. Some of you may notice a watering of the eyes. Others feel a pulling sensation. Both are signs that hypnosis is developing.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Breathe in once more... letting the breath fill your entire chest cavity... hold... and as you exhale, notice your eyes wanting to close. When the desire becomes strong enough, allow them to close naturally.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

If your eyes have not yet closed, take another breath and let them close with the exhale. There is no rush. Your eyes will close when they are ready.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Eyes now closed... feel the relief. In this safe, deep state, you can revisit the past without being trapped there. You are an adult visitor, bringing healing.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Now that your eyes are closed, bring your attention to your breathing. Allow each breath to deepen the relaxation flowing through your body.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

With your next breath, focus on your scalp. Feel it softening, relaxing. Any tension held there simply melting away. Warmth spreading across the top of your head.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

This warmth flows down to your forehead. Feel the muscles of your forehead smoothing out. All worry lines dissolving. Your forehead becoming cool, calm, completely relaxed.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Down to your eyes now—those tired muscles resting deeply. Your eyelids becoming wonderfully heavy. As though tiny weights are gently pressing them down. So heavy that you have no desire to open them.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The relaxation spreads to your cheeks and jaw. Your jaw becoming slack. Your teeth parting slightly. All the tension that accumulates in your jaw throughout the day—released now.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Down into your neck. Feel each vertebra of your neck relaxing. The muscles on the sides and back of your neck becoming loose like warm rubber. Your head feeling balanced and light.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The wave of relaxation flows into your shoulders. Feel yours dropping now. Releasing their load. Becoming soft and heavy.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Down through your arms. The relaxation flowing like warm honey through your upper arms... your elbows... your forearms. Into your wrists and hands. Each finger becoming loose and heavy.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Your chest now. Feel your breathing becoming even slower, even deeper. Your heart beating calmly, steadily. A sense of compassion filling your entire chest.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The warmth spreads through your stomach. Any knots or butterflies dissolving completely. Your stomach becoming soft and relaxed.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Into your lower back. Feel it softening. The muscles along your spine releasing their grip. Your entire back sinking into whatever supports you.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Through your hips now, releasing any tightness held there. Down into your thighs. Your large leg muscles becoming completely limp, loose, and heavy.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Past your knees, into your calves. These muscles that carry you through each day—resting now. Completely at peace.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Into your ankles, your feet, your toes. Every muscle, every joint, every cell of your body now bathed in deep relaxation.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

You are deeply relaxed, Austin. Your body is at peace. Your mind is calm and compassionate. Ready to bring healing to the child within.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== DEEPENING - 20-Step Staircase (8-10 minutes) ===

In your mind's eye, you find yourself at the top of a beautiful staircase. This staircase has twenty steps, and it leads down through time—back to childhood, back to the moments when shame was first learned.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The banister is smooth beneath your hand. The steps are solid and safe. With each step you descend, you go deeper into hypnosis and closer to the child who needs your healing presence.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Step twenty. Taking the first step down. Beginning the journey backward in time.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step nineteen. Going deeper. Compassion growing in your heart.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step eighteen. Deeper still. The past becoming accessible.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step seventeen. Every step takes you deeper. Every step brings you closer to the child.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step sixteen. Mind quieting. Heart opening.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step fifteen. Halfway there. So relaxed. So ready to heal.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step fourteen. Deeper than before. Memories becoming visible.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step thirteen. Feeling profoundly at peace.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step twelve. Your healing presence is powerful.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step eleven. So comfortable. So compassionate.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step ten. Entering the deepest levels now. The child is near.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step nine. Your words will bring profound healing.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step eight. Going deeper still.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step seven. Profound love developing.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step six. Almost there, Austin.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step five. So deep now. Completely ready.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step four. Deeper than you have ever been.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step three. The child is just ahead.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step two. One more step.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step one. You step into a scene from childhood. You see yourself as a young boy. The adult you is here to bring healing. Everything you do here will transform the shame that was planted long ago.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== THERAPEUTIC CONTENT (15-18 minutes) ===

--- Meeting Your Younger Self ---

Look at the child before you. This is you—young, vulnerable, trying to navigate a world that was often confusing and sometimes harsh.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Notice what age this child appears to be. Perhaps five, or eight, or twelve. Your subconscious knows what age most needs healing today.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Look at the expression on this child's face. Perhaps you see fear, or sadness, or loneliness. Perhaps you see the weight of shame already settling on young shoulders.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

This child did not deserve to feel shame. No child does. Shame was learned through experiences and messages that were never about his worth—even if they felt that way.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Understanding What Happened ---

Allow a memory to surface now. A memory when shame was planted in your young heart. Perhaps a harsh word from a parent. Perhaps rejection from peers. Perhaps an experience that made you feel fundamentally flawed.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

You do not need to relive this memory fully. You can observe it from a safe distance, like watching a scene in a movie. The adult you is here, watching with the child.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Notice what happened. Notice what the child concluded about himself. Perhaps he concluded:
- "I am not good enough."
- "Something is wrong with me."
- "I am unlovable."
- "I am bad."

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

These conclusions made sense to a child's mind. When bad things happen, children assume they caused it. When adults are angry or critical, children assume they deserve it. This is how children think.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

But these conclusions were wrong. The child was not bad. The child was not broken. The child was innocent, doing the best he could.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Speaking Truth to the Child ---

Now, as the adult you, approach the child. Kneel down so you are at eye level. Let him see the love in your eyes.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Place your hand gently on his shoulder or take his hand. Feel the connection between you—the adult who has survived and the child who still needs healing.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Now speak to this child. Speak the words he needed to hear then but never received. Say them out loud in your mind:

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

"I know what happened hurt you. I know it made you feel like something was wrong with you. But I need you to know the truth."

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

"You are not bad. You were never bad. You were a child doing your best in a confusing world."

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

"The things that happened were not your fault. The harsh words, the criticism, the rejection—they were not about you. They were about the struggles of others."

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

"You are worthy of love. You always have been. There is nothing fundamentally wrong with you. You are good."

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Watch the child's face as he receives these words. Perhaps you see tears. Perhaps you see relief. Perhaps you see doubt—this child has believed the shame for so long.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Continue speaking: "I am you, grown up. I survived. I am here to tell you that you are going to be okay. You are going to learn that you are worthy. And I am going to help you remember."

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Giving What Was Missing ---

What did this child need that he did not receive? Perhaps he needed:
- Unconditional acceptance
- Protection from criticism
- The message that mistakes are okay
- Physical comfort and reassurance
- To be seen and valued for who he was

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

As the adult, you can give these things now. It is never too late.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

If the child needed a hug, embrace him now. Feel the connection. Let him feel your strength and protection.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

If the child needed words of affirmation, speak them now: "You are smart. You are capable. You are loved. You are enough exactly as you are."

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

If the child needed protection, tell him: "I will protect you. No one gets to define your worth. You are safe with me."

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let this giving flow from your heart. The child receives what he has been missing all these years.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Releasing the Shame ---

The shame this child carried was never his to carry. It was placed on him by circumstances, by others' words, by a child's misunderstanding of the world.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Now it is time to release it.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Imagine the shame as a heavy cloak that has been wrapped around this child's shoulders. It was put there by others, by circumstances, by false beliefs.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Together, you and the child lift this cloak off his shoulders. Feel its weight. This is the shame he has carried.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Now, drop this cloak. Watch it fall to the ground. It was never his to wear. It never told the truth about who he was.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Without the cloak, the child stands taller. Lighter. Freer. The shame is on the ground, where it belongs. It will dissolve and disappear.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Integration ---

This child is part of you. He lives within you still. As he heals, you heal.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Invite this child to come with you—not to leave the past, but to be integrated into who you are now. He can live in your heart, finally free of the shame that burdened him.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Place your hand over your heart. Feel the child settling there, safe and loved. He is home. He is part of you. And he is free.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Anchor Reinforcement ---

Place your palm on your chest now, reinforcing your anchor.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Feel the warmth spreading. This is self-compassion that extends to every age you have ever been. The child within you is loved. The adult you is loved. All of you is worthy.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Say internally: "I am not my childhood shame. I am a child of God. My worth was established before any of it happened."

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

This anchor now carries the healing of today's session.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Release your hand.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== POST-HYPNOTIC SUGGESTIONS (2-3 minutes) ===

Let this healing sink deep into your subconscious mind now.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The child within you has heard the truth and received the love he needed. This healing will continue to unfold in the days and weeks ahead.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When old shame surfaces, you will recognize it as an old message from childhood—not the truth about who you are now.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You will treat yourself with the same compassion you showed the child today. You will speak kindly to yourself, as you spoke kindly to him.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The cloak of shame has been removed. You walk lighter, freer, more aware of your worth.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This healing is permanent. The child within is free.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== EMERGENCE (3-5 minutes) ===

It is time to return to full waking consciousness, bringing the healing with you.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

In a moment, I will count from one to ten. With each number, you will become more alert, more awake, while the healing remains permanent.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One. Beginning the journey back. The child is at peace in your heart.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Two. Feeling energy returning to your body. Lighter now.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Three. The shame cloak is gone forever.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Four. Your mind clearing. Your heart full.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Five. Halfway back now. Feeling healed. Feeling whole.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Six. More alert with each breath. Self-compassion flowing.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Seven. Almost there. The child is integrated and free.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Eight. Eyes preparing to open. Gratitude for this healing.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Nine. Nearly fully awake. Taking a deep, refreshing breath.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Ten. Eyes open, fully alert, completely refreshed, and healed at the deepest level.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Welcome back, Austin. You have done profound healing work today.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

The child within you has heard the truth and received the love he needed. The cloak of shame has been removed. He walks with you now, free and whole.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Be gentle with yourself in the coming days. This healing will continue to unfold. When old feelings arise, remember: they are echoes of the past, not the truth of who you are.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

You have given yourself an incredible gift today—the gift of healing the past and freeing the child within.
