=== PRE-TALK / SETTLING (2-3 minutes) ===

Welcome, Austin. I am glad you are here. Today begins a journey of profound healing—a journey to understand and overcome the heavy weight of guilt and shame.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

These two emotions, guilt and shame, are often confused with one another. But they are very different. And understanding the difference is the first step to freedom.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Guilt, when healthy, serves a purpose. It tells us when we have strayed from our values, when we have done something that does not align with who we want to be. Healthy guilt points us toward repair and growth.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Shame is different. Shame does not say, "I did something bad." Shame says, "I am bad." Shame attacks your very identity, your core worth as a person. And shame rarely leads to positive change—it leads to hiding, isolation, and more of the behaviors you wish to overcome.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Over these sessions, you will learn to distinguish between them. You will heal the wounds that shame has caused. You will discover your inherent worth—not worth you must earn, but worth you already possess as a child of God.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Find a comfortable position now. Allow your body to settle. This is safe space. Here, you can look at shame without being consumed by it. Let us begin.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== INDUCTION - Eye Fatigue with Diaphragmatic Breathing (10-12 minutes) ===

Begin by finding a spot on the ceiling or wall, slightly above your natural line of sight. A spot that requires you to look upward without straining your neck.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Focus on that spot. Keep your eyes fixed there as you begin to breathe deeply. Diaphragmatic breathing—belly expanding as you breathe in, sinking as you breathe out.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Breathe in through your nose... belly rising gently... hold for a moment... and release through your mouth. With this exhale, release any shame you are carrying right now. You can pick it up and examine it later. For now, just let it rest.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Continue gazing at that spot. Notice how your eyes begin to feel. A slight strain. A heaviness developing. This is natural and welcome. With each breath, this heaviness increases.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Another breath now... deeper than before... belly expanding... hold... and release. Feel your nervous system beginning to calm. Shame lives in a dysregulated nervous system. As you relax, shame loses its grip.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Keep your eyes on that spot. They are growing heavier. The muscles around your eyes are tiring. Some of you may notice a watering of the eyes. Others feel a pulling sensation. Both are signs that hypnosis is developing.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Breathe in once more... letting the breath fill your entire chest cavity... hold... and as you exhale, notice your eyes wanting to close. When the desire becomes strong enough, allow them to close naturally.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

If your eyes have not yet closed, take another breath and let them close with the exhale. There is no rush. Your eyes will close when they are ready.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Eyes now closed... feel the relief. The muscles that were straining are now resting. Just as those tired muscles now rest, the tired parts of your soul that have carried shame for so long... they too can rest.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Now that your eyes are closed, bring your attention to your breathing. Allow each breath to deepen the relaxation flowing through your body.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

With your next breath, focus on your scalp. Feel it softening, relaxing. Any tension held there simply melting away. Warmth spreading across the top of your head.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

This warmth flows down to your forehead. Feel the muscles of your forehead smoothing out. All worry lines dissolving. Your forehead becoming cool, calm, completely relaxed.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Down to your eyes now—those tired muscles resting deeply. Your eyelids becoming wonderfully heavy. As though tiny weights are gently pressing them down. So heavy that you have no desire to open them.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The relaxation spreads to your cheeks and jaw. Your jaw becoming slack. Your teeth parting slightly. All the tension that accumulates in your jaw throughout the day—released now. Melting away like ice in warm water.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Down into your neck. Feel each vertebra of your neck relaxing. The muscles on the sides and back of your neck becoming loose like warm rubber. Your head feeling balanced and light.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The wave of relaxation flows into your shoulders. Shoulders are where we carry so much of life's burden—including the burden of shame. Feel yours dropping now. Releasing their load. Becoming soft and heavy.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Down through your arms. The relaxation flowing like warm honey through your upper arms... your elbows... your forearms. Into your wrists and hands. Each finger becoming loose and heavy.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Your chest now. Feel your breathing becoming even slower, even deeper. Your heart beating calmly, steadily. A sense of peace filling your entire chest cavity—the place where shame often sits like a weight.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The warmth spreads through your stomach. Any knots or butterflies dissolving completely. Your stomach becoming soft and relaxed. All digestive tension released.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Into your lower back—that area that works so hard. Feel it softening. The muscles along your spine releasing their grip. Your entire back sinking into whatever supports you.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Through your hips now, releasing any tightness held there. Down into your thighs. Your large leg muscles becoming completely limp, loose, and heavy. Like lead weights.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Past your knees, into your calves. These muscles that carry you through each day—resting now. Completely at peace.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Into your ankles, your feet, your toes. Every muscle, every joint, every cell of your body now bathed in deep relaxation.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

You are deeply relaxed, Austin. Your body is at peace. Your mind is calm and receptive. In this state, healing can occur. The better you feel, the deeper you go. The deeper you go, the more healing becomes possible.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== DEEPENING - 20-Step Staircase (8-10 minutes) ===

In your mind's eye, you find yourself at the top of a beautiful staircase. This staircase has twenty steps, and it leads down to a place of healing and understanding—a sanctuary where you can examine guilt and shame safely.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The banister is smooth beneath your hand. The steps are solid and safe. With each step you descend, you will go twice as deep into hypnosis, twice as deep into relaxation, and twice as open to healing.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Step twenty. Taking the first step down. Feeling relaxation deepen. Beginning your journey toward understanding.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step nineteen. Going deeper. Your subconscious mind opening to new understanding.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step eighteen. Deeper still. Leaving old beliefs about shame at the surface while you journey below.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step seventeen. Every step takes you deeper. Every step takes you closer to healing.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step sixteen. Mind quieting. Old shame messages growing distant.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step fifteen. Halfway there. So relaxed. So safe. Ready to learn.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step fourteen. Deeper than before. Your protective walls gently softening.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step thirteen. Feeling profoundly at peace.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step twelve. Your subconscious ready to receive truth about your worth.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step eleven. So comfortable. So open.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step ten. Entering the deepest levels now. The sanctuary is near.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step nine. Every suggestion will be received powerfully.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step eight. Going deeper still.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step seven. Profound peace developing.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step six. Almost there, Austin.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step five. So deep now. Completely ready.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step four. Deeper than you have ever been.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step three. The sanctuary door is just ahead.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step two. One more step.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step one. You step off the staircase into a beautiful sanctuary. You are in the deepest state of hypnosis. Here, you are completely safe to explore guilt and shame without being harmed by them. Everything you hear will be absorbed completely by your subconscious mind.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== THERAPEUTIC CONTENT (15-18 minutes) ===

You remain in complete control. Your deeper mind will accept only the suggestions that align with your values and serve your growth. Everything else simply fades away.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

--- The Critical Difference: Guilt vs. Shame ---

In this sanctuary of your mind, you can see clearly what was confused before. Let me illuminate the crucial difference between guilt and shame.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Guilt says, "I did something bad."
Shame says, "I am bad."

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Guilt is about behavior. Shame is about identity.
Guilt is specific. Shame is global.
Guilt motivates repair. Shame motivates hiding.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Healthy guilt is like a helpful alarm. It goes off when your actions have violated your values. It prompts you to apologize, to make amends, to do better. Then it turns off. Its job is done.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Shame is different. Shame is a fire alarm that never stops ringing, even when there is no fire. It tells you that you are fundamentally flawed, inherently broken, beyond repair. It is not about what you did—it is about who you are.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Here is a key insight, Austin. When the Savior taught repentance, He was addressing guilt—the recognition that we have sinned and need to change. He never taught shame. He never said you were worthless. He said you were worth dying for.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Where Shame Comes From ---

Where did your shame originate? Shame is learned. No baby is born feeling shame. It develops through experiences, through messages received from others, through interpretations of painful events.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Shame often develops in childhood. Perhaps a parent's criticism felt like rejection of who you were, not just what you did. Perhaps you experienced something that made you feel fundamentally different, broken, or bad.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Shame can develop from trauma. When something bad happens to us, our minds sometimes conclude that we must be bad too. This is a lie, but a lie that feels deeply true.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Shame can develop from repeated failure. If you have struggled with a sin or weakness, each failure may have added another layer of shame—the belief that you will never change because something is fundamentally wrong with you.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

In this sanctuary, you can see that shame was installed through experiences. It was learned. And what is learned can be unlearned. This is the great hope.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- The Shame Spiral ---

Shame operates in a vicious cycle. Let me show you how it works so you can recognize it and interrupt it.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

First comes a trigger. Something happens—a mistake, a failure, a memory, even a criticism.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Then comes the shame thought: "I am worthless. I am broken. I will never change. Something is fundamentally wrong with me."

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

These thoughts produce shame feelings—heaviness in the chest, desire to hide, disconnection from others, self-loathing.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The feelings often lead to shame behaviors—isolating, numbing, or acting out. Ironically, many addictive behaviors are attempts to escape shame, but they create more shame.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

And the cycle continues. Trigger, thought, feeling, behavior—round and round, deeper into the spiral.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

But here is the secret: you can interrupt this cycle at any point. You can challenge the shame thought. You can soothe the shame feeling. You can choose a different behavior. You have more power than shame wants you to believe.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Installing Your Anchor ---

We are going to create an anchor now. This anchor will be a resource you can access anytime you feel shame arising.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Place your palm gently on your chest, over your sternum—the bone in the center of your chest. Let your whole palm rest there, fingers spread softly.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This is the gesture of self-compassion. It is the gesture of worth. It says, "I am enough. I am worthy. I am loved."

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

As you hold your palm there, feel warmth spreading from your hand into your chest. This warmth is self-compassion. It is understanding for your own humanity. It is the truth of your divine worth.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Say internally, while holding this gesture: "I am not my shame. I am a child of God. My worth is not in question."

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Whenever shame arises in your life, you will place your palm on your chest and access this feeling. This anchor will remind you of the truth—that shame is a liar, and you are worthy of love.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Release your hand now. The anchor is installed. We will strengthen it throughout this series.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Guilt Can Be Healthy ---

Before we finish today, let us honor healthy guilt. Guilt, properly understood, is a gift.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Healthy guilt tells you when you have strayed from your values. It prompts you to make things right. Without guilt, we would never repent, never apologize, never grow.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The Apostle Paul distinguished between "godly sorrow" and "the sorrow of the world." Godly sorrow leads to repentance and life. The sorrow of the world—shame—leads to death.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When you feel guilty about something you have done, ask yourself: Is this prompting me to change, to make amends, to grow? If so, listen to it. Take action. Then let it go.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Or is this telling me I am worthless, beyond hope, fundamentally broken? If so, that is shame, and it is a lie. Challenge it. Use your anchor. Remember your worth.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Your True Identity ---

Austin, I want to speak truth into the deepest part of your being. This is the truth that shame has tried to hide from you.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You are a child of God. Before this world was created, you existed in His presence. He knew you then. He knows you now. He loves you—not because of what you do, but because of who you are.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Your mistakes do not define you. Your failures do not define you. Your struggles do not define you. These are things you have done or experienced. They are not who you are.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Who you are is a son of God with infinite potential, divine heritage, and eternal worth. This worth was given to you before you did anything to earn it. And it cannot be taken away by anything you do.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The Savior did not come to condemn you. He came to save you. He has already paid the price for your mistakes. His Atonement covers not just the guilt of sin, but the shame that sin produces.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You can be free of shame. This is His promise. This is your birthright. This series will help you claim it.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== POST-HYPNOTIC SUGGESTIONS (2-3 minutes) ===

Let these truths sink deep into your subconscious mind now.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You will begin to distinguish between guilt and shame. When guilt arises about something you have done, you will respond with action—repentance, apology, growth. When shame arises about who you are, you will recognize it as false and use your anchor to access truth.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Whenever shame begins to rise, you will place your palm on your chest and remember: I am not my shame. I am a child of God. My worth is not in question.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Each day, you will become more aware of shame triggers and shame spirals. This awareness gives you power to interrupt the cycle.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You will find yourself naturally extending compassion to yourself—the same compassion you would extend to a beloved friend who made a mistake.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

These truths are now part of you. They will continue working in your subconscious, healing shame at its roots.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== EMERGENCE (3-5 minutes) ===

It is time to return to full waking consciousness, bringing all you have learned with you.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

In a moment, I will count from one to ten. With each number, you will become more alert, more awake, while the healing continues in your subconscious.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One. Beginning the journey back. New understanding planted.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Two. Feeling energy returning to your body. Lighter now.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Three. The difference between guilt and shame is clear.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Four. Your mind clearing. Your worth established.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Five. Halfway back now. Feeling hopeful. Healing has begun.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Six. More alert with each breath. Your anchor is installed.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Seven. Almost there. Ready to live this new understanding.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Eight. Eyes preparing to open. Compassion for yourself growing.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Nine. Nearly fully awake. Taking a deep, refreshing breath.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Ten. Eyes open, fully alert, completely refreshed, and beginning your journey from shame to freedom.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Welcome back, Austin. You have taken the first step on a profound healing journey.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

You now understand the difference between guilt and shame. Guilt is about behavior and can be addressed through repentance. Shame is about identity and is always a lie.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Your anchor is installed—palm on chest, feeling of worth. Use it whenever shame arises.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

In the sessions ahead, we will go deeper. We will heal the roots of shame. We will establish your worth on unshakeable foundations.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

For now, remember: You are not your shame. You are a child of God. Your worth is not in question.
