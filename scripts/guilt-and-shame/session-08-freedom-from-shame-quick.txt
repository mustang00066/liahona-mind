=== PRE-TALK / SETTLING (1-2 minutes) ===

Welcome to your final session, Austin. You have walked a profound healing journey. Today we integrate everything, seal your healing, and send you forward in freedom.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

This is not an ending—it is a graduation. Everything you have learned is now part of you. The transformation is complete.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Take a moment to honor how far you have come. You chose to face shame rather than hide from it. You are not the same person who started this journey. Let us begin.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== INDUCTION - Rapid Relaxation with Breathing (5-6 minutes) ===

Take a deep breath now. Diaphragmatic breathing—belly expanding as you breathe in, sinking as you breathe out.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Breathe in through your nose... belly rising gently... hold for a moment... and release through your mouth. With this exhale, feel gratitude for how far you have come.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Another breath... deeper... and as you exhale, allow your eyes to close naturally.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let your neck become loose like rubber bands. Head floating like a helium balloon. Jaws sagging. Shoulders dropping—no more weight of shame.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Arms becoming limp, loose, and heavy. All the way down to your hands.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Legs and feet the same. The better you feel, the deeper you go. Your freedom is being sealed.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Your eyelids becoming wonderfully heavy. As though gently stuck together. You are ready for the final sealing.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

One. You step into the celebration hall. Your freedom from shame is honored forever. Everything you hear will be absorbed completely.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== THERAPEUTIC CONTENT (8-10 minutes) ===

Receive only what serves you. Your subconscious mind will accept what is true for you and let the rest go.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Austin, you came carrying a heavy burden. Shame had told you lies about your worth. But you chose to heal. You showed up. You were brave. Honor your perseverance.

Whenever shame arises, use this anchor. Everything you need is here.

The Savior bore your shame. He experienced it so you do not have to carry it. You are free indeed.
