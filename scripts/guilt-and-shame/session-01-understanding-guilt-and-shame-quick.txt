=== PRE-TALK / SETTLING (1-2 minutes) ===

Welcome, Austin. Today begins a profound healing journey—a journey to understand and overcome guilt and shame.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

These two emotions are often confused. But they are very different. Guilt says, "I did something bad." Shame says, "I am bad." Understanding this difference is the first step to freedom.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Over these sessions, you will heal the wounds shame has caused and discover your inherent worth as a child of God. Let us begin.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== INDUCTION - Rapid Relaxation with Breathing (5-6 minutes) ===

Take a deep breath now. Diaphragmatic breathing—belly expanding as you breathe in, sinking as you breathe out.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Breathe in through your nose... belly rising gently... hold for a moment... and release through your mouth. With this exhale, release any shame you are carrying. You can examine it later. For now, let it rest.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Another breath... deeper... and as you exhale, allow your eyes to close naturally.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let your neck become loose like rubber bands. Head floating like a helium balloon. Jaws sagging. Shoulders dropping—releasing all tension.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Arms becoming limp, loose, and heavy. All the way down to your hands.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Legs and feet the same. The better you feel, the deeper you go. The deeper you go, the more healing becomes possible.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Your eyelids becoming wonderfully heavy. As though gently stuck together. You are ready to learn and heal.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== DEEPENING (3-4 minutes) ===

Imagine yourself at the top of a staircase... ten steps leading down to a sanctuary of healing and understanding.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Ten. Stepping down. Relaxation deepening.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Nine. Deeper. Your mind opening to truth.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Eight. Old shame messages growing distant.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Seven. Deeper still.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Six. Halfway there.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Five. So deep. So safe.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Four. Almost there.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Three. Deep healing possible.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Two. One more step.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

One. You enter the sanctuary. You are in a deep state of hypnosis. Everything you hear will be absorbed completely.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== THERAPEUTIC CONTENT (8-10 minutes) ===

Receive only what serves you. Your subconscious mind will accept what is true for you and let the rest go.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

--- The Critical Difference ---

In this sanctuary, you can see clearly what was confused before.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Guilt says, "I did something bad."
Shame says, "I am bad."

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Guilt is about behavior. Shame is about identity.
Guilt motivates repair. Shame motivates hiding.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Healthy guilt is like a helpful alarm. It tells you when you have strayed from your values, prompts you to make amends, then turns off.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Shame is a fire alarm that never stops ringing. It tells you that you are fundamentally broken, beyond repair.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When the Savior taught repentance, He addressed guilt. He never taught shame. He never said you were worthless. He said you were worth dying for.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Where Shame Comes From ---

Shame is learned. No baby is born feeling shame. It develops through experiences and messages received from others.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Perhaps a parent's criticism felt like rejection of who you were. Perhaps painful experiences made you feel fundamentally different or broken. Perhaps repeated failure added layers of shame.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

What is learned can be unlearned. This is the great hope.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- The Shame Spiral ---

Shame operates in a vicious cycle. A trigger leads to shame thoughts—"I am worthless." These produce shame feelings—heaviness, desire to hide. The feelings lead to shame behaviors—isolating or acting out. And the cycle continues.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

But you can interrupt this cycle at any point. You have more power than shame wants you to believe.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Installing Your Anchor ---

Place your palm gently on your chest, over your sternum. Let your whole palm rest there.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This is the gesture of self-compassion. It says, "I am enough. I am worthy. I am loved."

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Feel warmth spreading from your hand into your chest. This warmth is the truth of your divine worth.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Say internally: "I am not my shame. I am a child of God. My worth is not in question."

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Whenever shame arises, you will place your palm on your chest and access this truth. The anchor is installed.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Release your hand now.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

--- Your True Identity ---

Austin, here is the truth shame has tried to hide from you.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

You are a child of God. He knew you before this world was created. He loves you—not because of what you do, but because of who you are.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your mistakes do not define you. Your failures do not define you. Who you are is a son of God with infinite potential and eternal worth.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The Savior came to save you, not condemn you. His Atonement covers not just the guilt of sin, but the shame that sin produces.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== POST-HYPNOTIC SUGGESTIONS (1 minute) ===

You will distinguish between guilt and shame. When guilt arises about something you did, you will respond with action. When shame arises about who you are, you will recognize it as false.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Whenever shame rises, you will use your anchor and remember: I am not my shame. I am a child of God.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== EMERGENCE (2-3 minutes) ===

It is time to return to full awareness, bringing all you have learned with you.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

I will count from one to five. With each number, you become more alert while healing continues.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

One. Beginning to return. New understanding planted.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Two. Energy returning. Lighter now.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Three. The difference between guilt and shame is clear.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Four. Almost fully alert. Your anchor is installed.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Five. Eyes open, fully awake, completely alert, and beginning your journey from shame to freedom.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Welcome back, Austin. You have taken the first step on a profound healing journey.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

You now understand: guilt is about behavior and can be addressed. Shame is about identity and is always a lie.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Your anchor is installed—palm on chest, feeling of worth. Use it whenever shame arises.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Remember: You are not your shame. You are a child of God. Your worth is not in question.
