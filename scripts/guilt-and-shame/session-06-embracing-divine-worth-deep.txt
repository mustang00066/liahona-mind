=== PRE-TALK / SETTLING (2-3 minutes) ===

Welcome back, Austin. Throughout this series, we have been dismantling shame. Today we build something unshakeable: a deep understanding of your divine worth.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Shame tells you that you are worthless, that your value depends on your performance, that your mistakes define you. This is a lie. The truth is that your worth was established before you did anything to earn it.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You are a child of God. This is not a metaphor or a nice saying—it is literal truth. Before this world existed, you were His. And nothing you can do can change that.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Today we anchor your identity not in what you do, but in who you are. When you truly understand your divine worth, shame loses its power forever.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Find a comfortable position. Allow your body to settle. This is sacred work. Let us begin.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== INDUCTION - Eye Fatigue with Diaphragmatic Breathing (10-12 minutes) ===

Begin by finding a spot on the ceiling or wall, slightly above your natural line of sight. A spot that requires you to look upward without straining your neck.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Focus on that spot. Keep your eyes fixed there as you begin to breathe deeply. Diaphragmatic breathing—belly expanding as you breathe in, sinking as you breathe out.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Breathe in through your nose... belly rising gently... hold for a moment... and release through your mouth. With this exhale, open yourself to truth about who you really are.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Continue gazing at that spot. Notice how your eyes begin to feel. A slight strain. A heaviness developing. This is natural and welcome. With each breath, this heaviness increases.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Another breath now... deeper than before... belly expanding... hold... and release. You are entering a sacred space where truth can be received at the deepest level.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Keep your eyes on that spot. They are growing heavier. The muscles around your eyes are tiring. Some of you may notice a watering of the eyes. Others feel a pulling sensation. Both are signs that hypnosis is developing.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Breathe in once more... letting the breath fill your entire chest cavity... hold... and as you exhale, notice your eyes wanting to close. When the desire becomes strong enough, allow them to close naturally.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

If your eyes have not yet closed, take another breath and let them close with the exhale. There is no rush. Your eyes will close when they are ready.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Eyes now closed... feel the relief. In this deep, receptive state, you can receive truth that will transform how you see yourself forever.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Now that your eyes are closed, bring your attention to your breathing. Allow each breath to deepen the relaxation flowing through your body.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

With your next breath, focus on your scalp. Feel it softening, relaxing. Any tension held there simply melting away. Warmth spreading across the top of your head.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

This warmth flows down to your forehead. Feel the muscles of your forehead smoothing out. All worry lines dissolving. Your forehead becoming cool, calm, completely relaxed.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Down to your eyes now—those tired muscles resting deeply. Your eyelids becoming wonderfully heavy.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The relaxation spreads to your cheeks and jaw. Your jaw becoming slack. Your teeth parting slightly.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Down into your neck. Feel each vertebra of your neck relaxing. The muscles on the sides and back of your neck becoming loose like warm rubber.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The wave of relaxation flows into your shoulders. Feel yours dropping now. Releasing their load. Becoming soft and heavy.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Down through your arms. The relaxation flowing like warm honey through your upper arms... your elbows... your forearms. Into your wrists and hands. Each finger becoming loose and heavy.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Your chest now. Feel your breathing becoming even slower, even deeper. Your heart beating calmly, steadily. A sense of being loved filling your entire chest.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The warmth spreads through your stomach. Any knots or butterflies dissolving completely.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Into your lower back. Feel it softening. The muscles along your spine releasing their grip.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Through your hips now, releasing any tightness. Down into your thighs. Your large leg muscles becoming completely limp, loose, and heavy.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Past your knees, into your calves. Resting now. Completely at peace.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Into your ankles, your feet, your toes. Every muscle, every joint, every cell bathed in deep relaxation.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

You are deeply relaxed, Austin. Your body is at peace. Your mind is open and receptive. Ready to receive the truth of your divine worth.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== DEEPENING - 20-Step Staircase (8-10 minutes) ===

In your mind's eye, you find yourself at the top of a beautiful staircase. This staircase has twenty steps, and it leads down to a sacred place—a temple of truth where your divine identity is revealed.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The banister is smooth beneath your hand. The steps are solid and safe. With each step you descend, you will go deeper into hypnosis and closer to understanding who you really are.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Step twenty. Taking the first step down. Feeling relaxation deepen. Approaching sacred truth.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step nineteen. Going deeper. The world's lies about your worth fading.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step eighteen. Deeper still. Divine truth becoming accessible.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step seventeen. Every step takes you deeper. Every step brings you closer to your true identity.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step sixteen. Mind quieting. Heart opening to receive.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step fifteen. Halfway there. So relaxed. So ready for truth.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step fourteen. Deeper than before. Your worth becoming clear.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step thirteen. Feeling profoundly at peace.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step twelve. Your divine identity is becoming visible.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step eleven. So comfortable. So beloved.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step ten. Entering the deepest levels now. The temple is near.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step nine. Everything you hear will transform your understanding of yourself.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step six. Almost there, Austin.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step five. So deep now. Completely ready.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step four. Deeper than you have ever been.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step three. The temple doors are just ahead.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step two. One more step.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step one. You step into the temple of truth. Light surrounds you. Peace fills you. Here, you will understand who you really are.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== THERAPEUTIC CONTENT (15-18 minutes) ===

You remain in complete control. Your deeper mind will accept only the suggestions that align with your values and serve your growth. Everything else simply fades away.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

--- Your Divine Origin ---

Before this world was created, Austin, you existed. Not as a vague concept or potential being—but as you. A child of Heavenly Parents. A spirit with personality, potential, and worth.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

In that pre-mortal existence, you were known. You were loved. You were valued—not for what you would do, but for who you were.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your worth was established then. It was given to you as a birthright. And nothing—nothing you have done, nothing that has happened to you, nothing you will ever do—can change that foundational worth.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

This is not something you must earn. It is not something you can lose. It is not contingent on your performance. It simply is.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- The Source of True Worth ---

The world has many measures of worth: achievement, appearance, wealth, status, popularity. These are all external, all fragile, all unstable.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

If your worth depends on success, what happens when you fail? If your worth depends on others' approval, what happens when they criticize you? If your worth depends on never making mistakes, what happens when you fall?

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This is why shame has had power over you. You have been measuring yourself by unstable standards.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

But divine worth is different. It does not fluctuate. It does not depend on comparison. It simply exists, as a gift from the God who made you.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

In this temple of truth, you can see it clearly: your worth is not in question. It never was.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- What the Savior's Atonement Says About Your Worth ---

Consider the Atonement. Jesus Christ, the Son of God, gave His life for you. He suffered for your sins, your pains, your sorrows.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Why would He do that for someone who was worthless? He would not. He did it because you are infinitely valuable to Him.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The cross is the ultimate statement about your worth. It says: "You are worth dying for."

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Not because of what you have done. Not because you deserved it. But because of who you are—a beloved child of God, worth the infinite price of a Savior's blood.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let this truth sink in. You are not worthless. You are priceless.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Identity Beyond Behavior ---

Austin, you are not defined by your worst moments. You are not the sum of your failures. You are not your sins, your weaknesses, your struggles.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

These are things you have done or experienced. They are not who you are.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Who you are is a son of God. This is your identity. This is the bedrock on which your sense of self can stand.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When shame says, "Look at what you've done. You're worthless," you can reply: "That is something I did. It is not who I am. I am a child of God, and my worth is not in question."

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Your identity is prior to your behavior. It is deeper than your mistakes. It is more fundamental than your failures.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Receiving Divine Love ---

In this temple of truth, allow yourself to feel the love that God has for you.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Not the love you imagine He should have, or the love you think you deserve. His actual love—which is unconditional, unchanging, and infinite.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

He loves you on your worst day exactly as much as He loves you on your best day. His love is not earned by good behavior or forfeited by bad behavior. It simply is.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Many people believe in God's love intellectually but do not feel it. Shame has blocked the feeling.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

But here, in this deep state, you can bypass shame and receive His love directly.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Open your heart now. Imagine His love as warm, golden light surrounding you, penetrating you, filling every cell of your being.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Feel it in your chest. Feel it in your stomach. Feel it in your limbs. You are loved. You are cherished. You are His.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Anchor Reinforcement ---

Place your palm on your chest now.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This anchor carries the truth of your divine worth. When you use it, you access the reality that you are a child of God, that your worth is not in question, that you are loved unconditionally.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Say internally: "I am a child of God. My worth is inherent, not earned. I am loved beyond measure."

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

This anchor is now the gateway to your divine identity. When shame attacks, use it and remember who you really are.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Release your hand.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Living from Divine Worth ---

When you know your worth, you live differently.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You do not need others' approval to feel valuable—you already are valuable. You do not need to prove yourself—you are already proven. You do not need to achieve in order to matter—you matter because you exist.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This frees you to love, to serve, to risk, to grow—not to earn worth, but because you already have it.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

From a place of secure identity, you can face failures without being destroyed. You can receive criticism without being crushed. You can acknowledge weaknesses without feeling worthless.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This is freedom. This is what life looks like when shame no longer has power.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== POST-HYPNOTIC SUGGESTIONS (2-3 minutes) ===

Let these truths sink deep into your subconscious mind now.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your worth is inherent, not earned. It was established before you were born and cannot be changed by anything you do.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You are a child of God. This is your true identity—prior to your behavior, deeper than your mistakes, more fundamental than your failures.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When shame attacks your worth, your anchor will activate. You will remember who you really are and shame will lose its power.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You are loved by God unconditionally. This love is not earned by good behavior or lost by bad behavior. It simply is.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

These truths are now the foundation of your identity. They are permanent and unshakeable.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== EMERGENCE (3-5 minutes) ===

It is time to return to full waking consciousness, bringing your divine identity with you.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

In a moment, I will count from one to ten. With each number, you will become more alert, more awake, while your worth remains secure.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One. Beginning the journey back. Divine worth established.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Two. Feeling energy returning to your body. Beloved.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Three. Your identity is secure.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Four. Your mind clearing. Your worth unshakeable.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Five. Halfway back now. Feeling loved. Feeling valuable.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Six. More alert with each breath. Shame losing power.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Seven. Almost there. Ready to live from your true identity.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Eight. Eyes preparing to open. Filled with light.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Nine. Nearly fully awake. Taking a deep, refreshing breath.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Ten. Eyes open, fully alert, completely refreshed, and knowing who you really are.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Welcome back, Austin. You have touched something sacred today.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

You are a child of God. Your worth is not in question. You are loved unconditionally. These are not hopes—they are facts.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Live from this truth. When shame attacks, use your anchor and remember who you really are. Your identity is secure, and nothing can change it.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

You are His. You are loved. You are priceless.
