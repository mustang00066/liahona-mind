=== PRE-TALK / SETTLING (1-2 minutes) ===

Welcome back, Austin. Today we identify your personal shame triggers—the situations, words, and patterns that activate shame.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Awareness is power. When you know what triggers your shame, you can prepare for it, interrupt it, and eventually heal it at its roots.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

In this safe hypnotic state, you can observe your triggers without being overwhelmed. You have your anchor—palm on chest. You are ready. Let us begin.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== INDUCTION - Rapid Relaxation with Breathing (5-6 minutes) ===

Take a deep breath now. Diaphragmatic breathing—belly expanding as you breathe in, sinking as you breathe out.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Breathe in through your nose... belly rising gently... hold for a moment... and release through your mouth. With this exhale, create safety within yourself.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Another breath... deeper... and as you exhale, allow your eyes to close naturally.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let your neck become loose like rubber bands. Head floating like a helium balloon. Jaws sagging. Shoulders dropping—releasing all tension.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Arms becoming limp, loose, and heavy. All the way down to your hands.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Legs and feet the same. The better you feel, the deeper you go. You are developing the observer's mind—the ability to watch your experiences without being swept away.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Your eyelids becoming wonderfully heavy. As though gently stuck together. You are ready to explore with clarity.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== DEEPENING (3-4 minutes) ===

Imagine yourself at the top of a staircase... ten steps leading down to an observation room where your triggers can be safely examined.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Ten. Stepping down. Observer's mind strengthening.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Nine. Deeper. Ready to understand.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Eight. Safe and protected.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Seven. Deeper still.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Six. Halfway there.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Five. So deep. So observant.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Four. Almost there.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Three. Clarity developing.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Two. One more step.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

One. You enter the observation room. Here, your triggers are displayed safely. Everything you hear will be absorbed completely.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== THERAPEUTIC CONTENT (8-10 minutes) ===

Receive only what serves you. Your subconscious mind will accept what is true for you and let the rest go.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

--- The Five Categories ---

In this observation room, your triggers are organized into five categories.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

First: CRITICISM AND REJECTION. When someone criticizes you, does it feel like judgment of your worth? When you are rejected, does it feel like proof something is wrong with you?

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Second: FAILURE AND MISTAKES. Do you beat yourself up mercilessly? Do failures feel like exposure of fundamental inadequacy rather than normal learning?

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Third: APPEARANCE AND BODY. Do you carry shame about how you look? Are there parts of your body you hate?

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Fourth: SEXUALITY AND INTIMACY. Do you carry shame about your desires or past experiences? Not healthy guilt about behaviors, but shame that says you are dirty or broken?

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Fifth: ACHIEVEMENT AND COMPARISON. Do you measure your worth by achievements? When you see others succeeding, do you feel shame about your own life?

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let your subconscious identify which categories are most powerful for you.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Recognizing Shame Signals ---

Shame has physical signals: heat in your face, tightness in your chest, an urge to shrink or hide.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Shame has mental signals: "I'm so stupid," "What's wrong with me?", "I'll never change."

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Shame has behavioral signals: withdrawing, becoming defensive, numbing, attacking yourself internally.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You are now programmed to recognize these signals early.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- The Pause Point ---

Between trigger and spiral, there is a moment. A pause point. This is where your power lies.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Installing this now. Whenever a shame trigger activates, you will notice. Before the spiral begins, you will pause.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

In that pause: Place your palm on your chest. Take one breath. Say, "This is a trigger. I am not my shame." Choose a conscious response.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The pause point is now installed.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Anchor Reinforcement ---

Place your palm on your chest now.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Feel the warmth spreading. This is self-compassion. This is your divine worth.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Say internally: "I am not my shame. I am a child of God. My worth is not in question."

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This anchor grows stronger each time. Release your hand now.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

--- Curiosity Replaces Fear ---

When you meet triggers with curiosity rather than fear, they lose power.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Instead of running, observe: "Interesting. Criticism activated my shame. I wonder why."

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Curiosity creates distance. Distance creates choice. Choice creates freedom.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== POST-HYPNOTIC SUGGESTIONS (1 minute) ===

You will recognize your shame triggers quickly. The five categories are mapped in your awareness.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

The pause point is installed. Between trigger and spiral, you will pause and choose.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You will meet triggers with curiosity. Each one is an opportunity to understand and heal.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== EMERGENCE (2-3 minutes) ===

It is time to return to full awareness, bringing your new abilities with you.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

I will count from one to five. With each number, you become more alert while trigger awareness remains active.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

One. Beginning to return. Trigger map installed.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Two. Energy returning. Observer's mind active.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Three. Pause point ready. Anchor strengthened.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Four. Almost fully alert. Knowledge is power.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Five. Eyes open, fully awake, completely alert, and equipped with powerful awareness.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Welcome back, Austin. You have mapped your shame triggers.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

You know the five categories and which are most powerful for you. You can recognize shame signals and have a pause point installed.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

In the sessions ahead, we will heal the roots. For now, observe your triggers with curiosity. They reveal where healing is most needed.
