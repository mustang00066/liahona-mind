=== PRE-TALK / SETTLING (2-3 minutes) ===

Welcome back, Austin. In our first session, you learned the crucial difference between guilt and shame. Today we go deeper. Today we identify your personal shame triggers—the situations, words, memories, and patterns that activate shame.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Awareness is power. When you know what triggers your shame, you can prepare for it, interrupt it, and eventually heal it at its roots.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This session may bring up uncomfortable feelings. That is expected and even useful. In this safe hypnotic state, you can observe your triggers without being overwhelmed by them. You can see them clearly without being consumed.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You have your anchor—palm on chest. You have the truth of your worth. With these resources, you are ready to explore your triggers. Let us begin.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== INDUCTION - Eye Fatigue with Diaphragmatic Breathing (10-12 minutes) ===

Begin by finding a spot on the ceiling or wall, slightly above your natural line of sight. A spot that requires you to look upward without straining your neck.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Focus on that spot. Keep your eyes fixed there as you begin to breathe deeply. Diaphragmatic breathing—belly expanding as you breathe in, sinking as you breathe out.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Breathe in through your nose... belly rising gently... hold for a moment... and release through your mouth. With this exhale, create safety within yourself. You are protected here.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Continue gazing at that spot. Notice how your eyes begin to feel. A slight strain. A heaviness developing. This is natural and welcome. With each breath, this heaviness increases.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Another breath now... deeper than before... belly expanding... hold... and release. You are developing the observer's mind—the ability to watch your experiences without being swept away by them.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Keep your eyes on that spot. They are growing heavier. The muscles around your eyes are tiring. Some of you may notice a watering of the eyes. Others feel a pulling sensation. Both are signs that hypnosis is developing.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Breathe in once more... letting the breath fill your entire chest cavity... hold... and as you exhale, notice your eyes wanting to close. When the desire becomes strong enough, allow them to close naturally.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

If your eyes have not yet closed, take another breath and let them close with the exhale. There is no rush. Your eyes will close when they are ready.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Eyes now closed... feel the relief. In this protected state, you can look at difficult things without being hurt by them. You are the observer, not the observed.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Now that your eyes are closed, bring your attention to your breathing. Allow each breath to deepen the relaxation flowing through your body.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

With your next breath, focus on your scalp. Feel it softening, relaxing. Any tension held there simply melting away. Warmth spreading across the top of your head.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

This warmth flows down to your forehead. Feel the muscles of your forehead smoothing out. All worry lines dissolving. Your forehead becoming cool, calm, completely relaxed.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Down to your eyes now—those tired muscles resting deeply. Your eyelids becoming wonderfully heavy. As though tiny weights are gently pressing them down. So heavy that you have no desire to open them.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The relaxation spreads to your cheeks and jaw. Your jaw becoming slack. Your teeth parting slightly. All the tension that accumulates in your jaw throughout the day—released now. Melting away like ice in warm water.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Down into your neck. Feel each vertebra of your neck relaxing. The muscles on the sides and back of your neck becoming loose like warm rubber. Your head feeling balanced and light.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The wave of relaxation flows into your shoulders. Shoulders are where we carry so much of life's burden. Feel yours dropping now. Releasing their load. Becoming soft and heavy.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Down through your arms. The relaxation flowing like warm honey through your upper arms... your elbows... your forearms. Into your wrists and hands. Each finger becoming loose and heavy.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Your chest now. Feel your breathing becoming even slower, even deeper. Your heart beating calmly, steadily. A sense of safety filling your entire chest cavity.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The warmth spreads through your stomach. Any knots or butterflies dissolving completely. Your stomach becoming soft and relaxed.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Into your lower back—that area that works so hard. Feel it softening. The muscles along your spine releasing their grip. Your entire back sinking into whatever supports you.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Through your hips now, releasing any tightness held there. Down into your thighs. Your large leg muscles becoming completely limp, loose, and heavy. Like lead weights.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Past your knees, into your calves. These muscles that carry you through each day—resting now. Completely at peace.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Into your ankles, your feet, your toes. Every muscle, every joint, every cell of your body now bathed in deep relaxation.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

You are deeply relaxed, Austin. Your body is at peace. Your mind is calm yet aware. From this observer's position, you can explore your triggers safely.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== DEEPENING - 20-Step Staircase (8-10 minutes) ===

In your mind's eye, you find yourself at the top of a beautiful staircase. This staircase has twenty steps, and it leads down to an observation room—a place where you can see your triggers displayed safely, like exhibits in a museum.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The banister is smooth beneath your hand. The steps are solid and safe. With each step you descend, you will go deeper into hypnosis and closer to understanding your patterns.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Step twenty. Taking the first step down. Feeling relaxation deepen. Observer's mind strengthening.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step nineteen. Going deeper. Ready to understand your triggers.

Step sixteen. Mind becoming still like a calm lake.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step fifteen. Halfway there. So relaxed. So observant.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step fourteen. Deeper than before. Patterns beginning to become visible.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step thirteen. Feeling profoundly at peace while fully aware.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step five. So deep now. Completely ready to see clearly.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step four. Deeper than you have ever been.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step three. The observation room door is just ahead.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step two. One more step.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step one. You step into the observation room. Here, your shame triggers are displayed like exhibits—visible but unable to harm you. You can study them with curiosity rather than fear.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== THERAPEUTIC CONTENT (15-18 minutes) ===

--- The Five Categories of Shame Triggers ---

In this observation room, you can see your triggers organized into five categories. Let us explore each one.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The first category is CRITICISM AND REJECTION.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

For many people, criticism triggers deep shame. Not just frustration or disappointment—but the feeling of being fundamentally flawed. The criticism does not feel like feedback about behavior; it feels like judgment of your worth.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Notice if this is true for you. When someone criticizes your work, do you feel like a failure as a person? When someone expresses disappointment, do you feel unworthy of love?

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Rejection works similarly. When you are not included, not chosen, not wanted—does it feel like proof that something is wrong with you?

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

In the observation room, you can see specific memories when criticism or rejection triggered shame. They are displayed safely behind glass. What do you notice?

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The second category is FAILURE AND MISTAKES.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Everyone fails. Everyone makes mistakes. But for some, failure does not feel like a normal part of learning—it feels like exposure of their fundamental inadequacy.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Notice how you relate to your mistakes. Do you beat yourself up mercilessly? Do you replay them endlessly? Do you feel like a mistake defines you rather than teaches you?

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Perhaps there are specific failures that still carry shame—things you did years ago that you cannot forgive yourself for. They are displayed here in the observation room. What do you see?

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The third category is APPEARANCE AND BODY.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Our culture teaches us to feel shame about our bodies. Too tall, too short, too heavy, too thin—there is always something "wrong." And this body shame can run deep.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Notice if you carry shame about your physical appearance. Are there parts of your body you hate? Do you feel inherently unattractive or undesirable?

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This shame often comes from messages received in childhood or adolescence—cruel comments, comparisons, cultural ideals you could not meet. These messages are displayed here. What do you observe?

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The fourth category is SEXUALITY AND INTIMACY.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Perhaps no area carries more shame than sexuality. Our natural desires, our struggles with pornography or lust, our past sexual experiences—these can become sources of profound shame.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Notice if you carry shame about your sexuality. Not healthy guilt about specific behaviors, but deep shame that says your desires themselves make you dirty or broken.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Perhaps you have sexual experiences in your past that you have never processed—things done to you or by you that created shame. They are displayed safely here. What do you see?

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The fifth category is ACHIEVEMENT AND COMPARISON.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

In a world of social media, we constantly compare our lives to others. And for many, this comparison triggers shame—the feeling of not measuring up, of being behind, of not being successful enough.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Notice if you measure your worth by your achievements. When you see others succeeding, do you feel shame about your own life? Do you feel like you should be further along by now?

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Perhaps there are specific achievements you expected of yourself that have not materialized—career goals, financial success, life milestones. These unmet expectations are displayed here. What do you observe?

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Your Personal Trigger Map ---

You have now observed the five categories. Let your subconscious identify which categories are most powerful for you.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Perhaps one or two categories light up more than others. Perhaps certain memories or patterns emerged. Your subconscious is creating a personal trigger map.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

This map is valuable. When you know your triggers, you are no longer ambushed by them. You can see them coming. You can prepare. You can respond rather than react.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Recognizing the Shame Spiral in Real Time ---

Now that you know your triggers, let us strengthen your ability to recognize when shame is activating.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Shame has physical signals. Notice what happens in your body when shame arises. Perhaps you feel:
- Heat or flushing in your face
- Tightness in your chest or throat
- An urge to shrink or hide
- A dropping sensation in your stomach
- Tension in your shoulders

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Shame has mental signals too. Notice the thoughts that accompany shame:
- "I'm so stupid"
- "What's wrong with me?"
- "I always mess up"
- "I'm worthless"
- "I'll never change"

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Shame has behavioral signals. Notice what you do when shame is active:
- Withdraw and isolate
- Become defensive or angry
- Numb with food, screens, or substances
- Seek reassurance compulsively
- Attack yourself internally

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

You are now programming your awareness to recognize these signals early—before shame spirals out of control.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- The Pause Point ---

Between trigger and spiral, there is a moment. A fraction of a second. A pause point. This is where your power lies.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When you recognize a trigger activating, you can pause. In that pause, you can choose a different response.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let me install this pause point in your subconscious now.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Whenever a shame trigger activates, you will notice. A gentle internal alert will sound. In that moment, before the spiral begins, you will pause.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

In that pause, you will:
- Place your palm on your chest
- Take one deep breath
- Say internally: "This is a trigger. I am not my shame."
- Choose a conscious response

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

This pause point is now installed. It will activate automatically when needed.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Anchor Reinforcement ---

Let us strengthen your anchor now. Place your palm on your chest.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Feel the warmth spreading from your hand into your heart. This is self-compassion. This is truth. This is your divine worth.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

As you hold this gesture, say internally: "I am not my shame. I am a child of God. My worth is not in question."

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

This anchor grows stronger each time you use it. When triggers arise, it is ready.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Release your hand now.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Curiosity Replaces Fear ---

One final gift for today. When you meet your triggers with curiosity rather than fear, they lose their power.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Instead of running from the trigger, you can observe it. "Interesting. Criticism activated my shame response. I wonder why that has so much power over me."

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Instead of believing the shame, you can question it. "Is it really true that I'm worthless because I made a mistake? Is that objectively true?"

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Curiosity creates distance. Distance creates choice. Choice creates freedom.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== POST-HYPNOTIC SUGGESTIONS (2-3 minutes) ===

Let these new abilities sink deep into your subconscious mind now.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You will recognize your shame triggers more quickly. The five categories—criticism, failure, appearance, sexuality, achievement—are now mapped in your awareness.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Whenever a trigger activates, you will notice the physical, mental, and behavioral signals of shame. This awareness gives you power.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The pause point is installed. Between trigger and spiral, you will pause, use your anchor, and choose a conscious response.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You will meet your triggers with curiosity rather than fear. Each trigger is an opportunity to understand yourself better and heal at deeper levels.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

These abilities are now part of you. They will continue developing in your subconscious.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== EMERGENCE (3-5 minutes) ===

It is time to return to full waking consciousness, bringing all you have learned with you.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

In a moment, I will count from one to ten. With each number, you will become more alert, more awake, while your trigger awareness remains active.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One. Beginning the journey back. Trigger map installed.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Two. Feeling energy returning to your body. Observer's mind active.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Three. Your awareness of shame signals is heightened.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Four. Your mind clearing. Pause point ready.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Five. Halfway back now. Feeling empowered. Knowledge is power.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Six. More alert with each breath. Curiosity replacing fear.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Seven. Almost there. Ready to apply what you have learned.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Eight. Eyes preparing to open. Anchor strengthened.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Nine. Nearly fully awake. Taking a deep, refreshing breath.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Ten. Eyes open, fully alert, completely refreshed, and equipped with powerful awareness.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Welcome back, Austin. You have mapped your shame triggers.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

You now know the five categories: criticism, failure, appearance, sexuality, and achievement. You know which ones are most powerful for you.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

You can recognize the signals of shame in your body, mind, and behavior. You have a pause point installed between trigger and spiral.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

In the sessions ahead, we will heal the roots of these triggers. For now, observe them with curiosity. They are revealing the places that most need healing.
