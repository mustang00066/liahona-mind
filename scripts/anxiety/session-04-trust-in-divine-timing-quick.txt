=== PRE-TALK / SETTLING (1-2 minutes) ===

Welcome back, [NAME]. Today we address the spiritual foundation of peace. Much anxiety comes from trying to control what cannot be controlled. True peace comes from trust.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

You were never meant to carry everything alone. Today, you'll learn to surrender what isn't yours to control... and in that surrender, find rest.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

The Savior invited, "Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest." Let us accept that invitation now.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== INDUCTION - Rapid Relaxation with Breathing (5-6 minutes) ===

Take a deep diaphragmatic breath. Belly breathing... when you breathe in, your belly expands. When you breathe out, it sinks down.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Breathe in through your nose... belly rising... hold gently... and release through your mouth, letting go of the need to control.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Another breath. This breathing stimulates your vagus nerve, which tells your brain to relax. In... belly expanding... hold... and release, relaxation spreading.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

One more breath... and as you exhale, allow your eyes to close naturally.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let your neck become loose like rubber bands. Your head floating like a balloon. Jaws sagging. Shoulders dropping completely.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Arms and hands becoming heavy... limp, loose, and heavy. Like lead weights hanging from your shoulders.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Legs and feet the same. So limp, so loose, so heavy with relaxation.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The better you feel, the deeper you go. The deeper you go, the better you feel.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== DEEPENING (3-4 minutes) ===

Imagine a stone pathway leading to a sacred cave behind a waterfall. Ten steps to deep peace.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Ten. Stepping forward. Going deeper.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Nine. The sound of water washing away worry.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Eight. Body so heavy and relaxed.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Seven. Mind quieting.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Six. Halfway there.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Five. Subconscious opening.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Four. Ready for surrender.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Three. Almost there.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Two. One more step.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

One. You enter the sacred cave. A loving presence surrounds you.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== THERAPEUTIC CONTENT (8-10 minutes) ===

--- The Burden of Control ---

[NAME], so much anxiety comes from carrying burdens you were never meant to carry. The burden of controlling outcomes. The burden of making sure everything turns out right.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

No human can control every outcome. Yet anxiety tells us we must try... that disaster will come if we let go. This is a lie.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

--- The Lilies of the Field ---

The Savior taught: "Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow. They toil not, neither do they spin. And yet Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these."

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The lilies don't worry about tomorrow. They bloom where they're planted, trusting that what they need will be provided. You can live this way too.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

--- The Prayer of Surrender ---

There is a prayer that releases you. Let these words echo in your mind:

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

"Father, I give this to you. I have done what I can. The rest is yours."

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

"I trust your timing. I release my need to control."

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Feel what happens as you surrender. Shoulders drop. Stomach unclenches. Heart opens. This is what trust feels like.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Active Faith ---

Surrender doesn't mean doing nothing. It means doing your part and releasing your attachment to outcomes. The farmer plants seeds but can't make them grow. He does his part and trusts.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

--- Direct Suggestions ---

From this day forward, you recognize when you're trying to control what cannot be controlled. You pause and ask: "Is this mine to carry?"

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The prayer of surrender becomes familiar. "I give this to you. I trust your timing." These words bring immediate relief.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your grip on life loosens... not because you don't care, but because you trust. In this loosened grip, you find peace that passes understanding.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

--- Strengthening the Anchor ---

Press your thumb and forefinger together now.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Feel this surrendered, trusting state flowing into your fingers. Divine peace stored in this gesture.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Release. The anchor grows stronger.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

--- Future Pacing ---

See yourself tomorrow. A worry arises about something you cannot control. You say the prayer of surrender. Peace comes.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

A week from now, surrender is natural. You do your part and leave the rest to God.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

A month from now, uncertainty no longer frightens you. You trust that God sees what you cannot.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== POST-HYPNOTIC SUGGESTIONS (1 minute) ===

This spiritual trust integrates into your being. Throughout your days, you'll release burdens to divine care.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Remember: You were never meant to carry everything alone. You can let go. You can trust.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== EMERGENCE (2-3 minutes) ===

Time to return, carrying trust with you.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

One. Beginning to return. Peace coming with you.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Two. Aware of your body. Burdens lighter.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Three. Energy returning. Spirit at peace.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Four. Almost fully alert. Feeling wonderful.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Five. Eyes open, fully awake, deeply peaceful in your spirit.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Welcome back, [NAME]. Remember the prayer: "I give this to you. I trust your timing."

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Go in peace. You do not walk alone.
