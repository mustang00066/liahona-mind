Duration: ~28 minutes
Voice: Male, British accent, calm and soothing

[BEGIN SCRIPT]

Welcome back, Austin. Today we explore the spiritual foundation of peace. Much anxiety comes from trying to control what cannot be controlled. True peace comes from trust.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Take a deep breath in... hold... and release, letting go of the need to control.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Another breath, deeper... surrendering to relaxation... hold... and release.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One more breath... eyes closing as you exhale, heart opening.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let relaxation flow through you. Head to toe. Golden warmth spreading. Shoulders dropping. Jaw releasing. Complete peace.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Descend now. Ten to one. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Deep peace.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You are in your garden of peace, Austin. Feel a loving presence here with you. Divine love, always available, always near.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Much anxiety comes from feeling alone with your burdens. Feeling that everything depends on you. This is an illusion.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The Savior said, Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Rest requires letting go. It requires trust.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Consider the lilies. They toil not. Yet Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. They trust, and so can you.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let us pray in silence: Lord, I give this to you. I have done what I can. The rest is yours. I trust your timing. I release control.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Feel what happens as you truly surrender. Shoulders drop. Stomach unclenches. Heart opens. This is what trust feels like.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Trust means doing your part and then releasing. Holding plans loosely. Accepting that God's timing may differ from yours.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The Lord promises: Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When anxiety arises from lack of control, remember: Do what you can, then surrender the rest. This is the path to peace.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One... beginning to return.
Two... feeling loved and supported.
Three... becoming alert.
Four... refreshed and trusting.
Five... eyes open, fully alert. You walk in trust now, Austin. God goes with you.
