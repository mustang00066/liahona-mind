[BEGIN SCRIPT]

Welcome back, Austin. This is our final anxiety session, and today we integrate everything you have learned. You are ready to live in lasting freedom from anxiety.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Find your comfortable position. Take a deep breath in... hold gently... and release, feeling how far you have come.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Another breath, deeper... celebrating your progress... hold... and release, relaxation coming easily now.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

One more breath... breathing in freedom... hold... and as you exhale, let your eyes close and feel the peace that is now yours.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let the golden light of peace begin at your head. This light is familiar now. It comes quickly. Scalp softening. Forehead smoothing. Eyes relaxing deeply.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The warmth flows through your body with practiced ease. Face, jaw, neck. Shoulders, arms, hands. Chest, stomach, back. Hips, legs, feet. Complete peace in moments.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Now the staircase. Twenty steps down to the deepest peace.

Twenty, nineteen, eighteen, seventeen, sixteen... going deeper.
Fifteen, fourteen, thirteen, twelve, eleven... relaxing fully.
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six... reaching mastery.
Five, four, three, two, one... deep hypnosis achieved.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

You are in your garden of peace. This garden has grown more beautiful over these sessions. The flowers are brighter. The air is sweeter. This is the garden of your transformed mind.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let us review what you have learned. You now have an entire toolkit for managing anxiety. These tools have become part of you.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

First, you discovered your inner peace. You know now that peace is your natural state. Anxiety was learned, and you have unlearned it. Your peace anchor brings instant calm whenever you need it.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Second, you learned to release physical tension. Your body is now an ally. You scan regularly, releasing tension before it builds. You breathe deeply, calming your nervous system. The 4-4-4 breath is always available.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Third, you learned to transform anxious thoughts. You recognize thoughts as thoughts, not facts. You question them, balance them, let them go. Your mind no longer spirals.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Fourth, you learned to trust divine timing. You do your part and release the outcome. You surrender what you cannot control. This brings profound spiritual peace.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Fifth, you learned calm in social situations. Your worth does not depend on others' opinions. You focus outward with curiosity. Social anxiety has loosened its grip.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Sixth, you learned to embrace uncertainty. You can say, I do not know, and that is okay. The need for certainty no longer tortures you. You live in the present.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Seventh, you learned to sleep peacefully. Your nights are for rest, not worry. You set thoughts aside and receive the gift of sleep.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

All of these tools are now part of your permanent mental landscape. They are available instantly, whenever you need them. You have become someone who manages anxiety masterfully.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The scripture promises, Ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free. You have learned many truths about anxiety: that it is learned, that it can be unlearned, that peace is your birthright, that you have power over your mind.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

These truths have set you free. Not just temporarily, but permanently. The changes in your brain are real. The new pathways are established. Freedom is your new normal.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This does not mean you will never feel anxiety again. You are human, and anxiety is part of the human experience. But when it arises, it will be manageable. It will be brief. It will not control your life.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You are no longer someone who suffers from anxiety. You are someone who experiences occasional anxious moments and knows exactly how to handle them.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Going forward, return to these sessions whenever you need a refresher. Use the daily boosters to maintain your practice. Your freedom requires some maintenance, but it is easy maintenance. A few minutes here and there.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Trust yourself. You have done the work. You have built the skills. You are capable and strong. Anxiety's power over you is broken.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The Savior's promise is yours: Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid. This peace is your inheritance.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Rest in this garden of peace for a moment longer. Feel gratitude for how far you have come. You chose to address your anxiety. You did the work. You succeeded.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

It is time to return now, for the final time in this series. As I count from one to ten, you will become alert, carrying lasting freedom with you.

One... beginning to return.
Two... feeling free and empowered.
Three... becoming more aware.
Four... refreshed and confident.
Five... halfway back.
Six... alertness increasing.
Seven... feeling wonderful.
Eight... almost there.
Nine... nearly fully awake.
Ten... eyes open, fully alert. You are free, Austin. Go and live in peace.
