Duration: ~28 minutes
Voice: Male, British accent, calm and soothing

[BEGIN SCRIPT]

Welcome back, Austin. Today we address anxiety's deep root: the fear of uncertainty. By learning to embrace the unknown, you free yourself from endless worry.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Take a deep breath in... hold... and release, letting go of the need to know.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Another breath, deeper... accepting this moment... hold... and release.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One more breath... eyes closing as you exhale, mind opening.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let relaxation flow through you. Head to toe. Golden warmth spreading. The thinking mind quieting. Complete peace.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Descend now. Ten to one. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Deep hypnosis.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Much anxiety comes from intolerance of uncertainty. The mind desperately wants to know what will happen. But life is fundamentally uncertain.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

No amount of worrying makes the future certain. Worry is not preparation. It is suffering in advance.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You have always lived with uncertainty. Every day, you did not know what would happen. And here you are. You have survived every uncertain day.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The scripture counsels, Be not afraid, only believe. Faith is moving forward despite uncertainty.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Think of something uncertain in your life. Feel the discomfort. Now, instead of fighting it, breathe into it. Say: I do not know, and that is okay.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Feel the relief from not needing to know. The struggle was with your resistance, not the uncertainty itself.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

I do not know, and that is okay. One of the most freeing sentences you can say.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You can plan, prepare, and act, but release the outcome. Trust that you will handle whatever comes. You always have.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your track record for getting through difficult things is one hundred percent. And most of what you worry about never happens anyway.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One... beginning to return.
Two... feeling free and accepting.
Three... becoming alert.
Four... refreshed and at peace.
Five... eyes open, fully alert. You embrace uncertainty now, Austin.
