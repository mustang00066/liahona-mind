=== PRE-TALK / SETTLING (1-2 minutes) ===

Welcome back, Austin. Today we address one of anxiety's deepest roots: the fear of uncertainty. The unknown future, the unanswered question, the outcome you cannot control.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Here's a liberating truth: you have always lived with uncertainty. Every day of your life, you didn't know what would happen next. Yet here you are. Your track record for handling the unknown is perfect.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

The Savior taught, "Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself." Today, we embrace this wisdom.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== INDUCTION - Rapid Relaxation (5-6 minutes) ===

Take a deep diaphragmatic breath. Belly breathing... belly expands in, sinks down out.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Breathe in through your nose... belly rising... hold gently... and release. This breathing stimulates your vagus nerve, signaling safety.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Another breath... and as you exhale, allow your eyes to close.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let your neck become loose like rubber bands. Your head floating like a balloon. Jaws sagging. Shoulders dropping completely.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Arms and hands becoming limp, loose, and heavy. Like lead weights hanging from your shoulders. So heavy you couldn't lift them.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Legs and feet the same. Limp, loose, and heavy. Lead weights. Completely letting go.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The better you feel, the deeper you go. The deeper you go, the better you feel.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your eyelids so relaxed they've become gently stuck together. The harder you might try to open them, the more they want to stay closed.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== DEEPENING (3-4 minutes) ===

Imagine standing at the edge of a misty meadow at dawn. Ten steps along the path lead to a place of peace with uncertainty.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Ten. Stepping through the gate. Going deeper.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Nine. Mist parting gently around you.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Eight. Body heavy and relaxed.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Seven. Mind quieting completely.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Six. Halfway there. Sky growing lighter.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Five. A peaceful clearing ahead.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Four. Ready to embrace the unknown.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Three. Almost there.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Two. One more step.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

One. You enter the clearing as the sun rises. Complete peace surrounds you.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== THERAPEUTIC CONTENT (8-10 minutes) ===

Receive only what serves you. Your subconscious mind will accept what is true for you and let the rest go.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

--- The Anxiety of Uncertainty ---

Austin, much of your anxiety comes from intolerance of uncertainty. The mind desperately wants guarantees, wants to see the path clearly before taking a step.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When certainty isn't available... which is almost always... anxiety fills the gap with worst-case scenarios. But here's the truth: no amount of worrying can make the future certain. Worry is suffering in advance for things that usually never happen.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

--- The Illusion of Certainty ---

Consider this: certainty is often an illusion anyway. How many times have you been "certain" only to have things turn out differently? Plans change. Life takes unexpected turns.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The only real certainty is this present moment. Right now, you are here. You are safe. You are breathing. Only now is real.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When you anchor yourself in the present moment, uncertainty loses its power. You're not controlling the entire future... you're just handling this moment. And this moment is manageable.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

--- I Do Not Know, And That Is Okay ---

Say these words in your mind: "I do not know how this will turn out. And that is okay."

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Feel what happens when you stop fighting. The struggle was never with uncertainty itself... it was with your resistance to it. When you stop resisting, peace becomes possible even without answers.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This is not resignation. You can still plan and prepare. But you release attachment to the outcome. You do your part and trust you'll handle whatever comes.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Because you will handle it. You always have. Every challenge that arrived, you faced. Every uncertain situation eventually resolved. You are here, proof of your own resilience.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

--- Direct Suggestions ---

From this day forward, you develop increasing tolerance for uncertainty. When you don't know how something will turn out, you can sit with that not-knowing peacefully.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You recognize that worry is not preparation. When you catch yourself worrying, you gently return to the present moment. You ask: "Am I okay right now?" The answer is almost always yes.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You make friends with the unknown. Instead of seeing uncertainty as threatening, you see it as possibility. The unknown future holds potential gifts you cannot yet imagine.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You trust in your own resilience. Whatever comes, you will face it. This trust allows you to move forward even without guarantees.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

--- Strengthening the Anchor ---

Press your thumb and forefinger together now.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Feel this peaceful acceptance of uncertainty flowing into your fingers. The freedom of not needing to know... the trust in your resilience... peace with the unknown.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Release. The anchor grows stronger.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

--- Future Pacing ---

See yourself tomorrow. An uncertain situation triggers worry. But you pause, say "I do not know, and that is okay," and the worry dissolves.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

A week from now, the constant need to know the future has loosened. You're more comfortable with open questions. Life feels lighter.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

A month from now, your relationship with uncertainty has transformed. You move through life with quiet confidence, trusting yourself even when you can't see the path ahead.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== POST-HYPNOTIC SUGGESTIONS (1 minute) ===

This peace with uncertainty integrates fully into your being. Each day, this tolerance deepens.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

"I do not know, and that is okay" becomes a natural response to the unknown.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== EMERGENCE (2-3 minutes) ===

Time to return, carrying acceptance with you.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

One. Beginning to return. Peace coming with you.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Two. Aware of your body. Relaxed but alert.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Three. Energy returning. Freedom rising.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Four. Almost fully alert. Feeling wonderful.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Five. Eyes open, fully awake, at peace with uncertainty.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Welcome back, Austin. Remember: You do not need to know how things will turn out. You only need to trust yourself and be present to this moment.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Go in peace. Walk forward into the unknown with confidence.
