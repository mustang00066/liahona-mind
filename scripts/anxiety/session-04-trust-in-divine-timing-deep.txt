Duration: ~38 minutes
Voice: Male, British accent, calm and soothing

[BEGIN SCRIPT]

Welcome back, Austin. Today we explore the spiritual foundation of peace. Much anxiety comes from trying to control what cannot be controlled. True peace comes from trust.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Find your comfortable position. Take a deep breath in... hold gently... and release, letting go of the need to control.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Another breath, deeper... surrendering to relaxation... hold... and release, trusting this process.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

One more breath... breathing in faith... hold... and as you exhale, let your eyes close and your heart open.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let the golden light of peace begin at your head. This light is divine love, surrounding you, filling you. Scalp softening. Forehead smoothing. Eyes relaxing.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The warmth flows down through your face. Jaw releasing. Neck letting go. Shoulders dropping, releasing the weight you have been carrying.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Down through your arms, your hands. Through your chest, where your heart opens to receive peace. Through your stomach, where worry dissolves. Through your entire body.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Now the staircase. Twenty steps down to the deepest peace.

Twenty, nineteen, eighteen, seventeen, sixteen... going deeper.
Fifteen, fourteen, thirteen, twelve, eleven... relaxing more.
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six... surrendering control.
Five, four, three, two, one... deep peace achieved.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

You are in your garden of peace. But notice now that you are not alone. Feel a loving presence here with you. This is divine love, always available, always near.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Much of your anxiety comes from feeling alone with your burdens. Feeling that everything depends on you. Feeling that if you do not control every outcome, disaster will follow.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This is an illusion. You were never meant to carry everything alone. The Savior said, Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Rest is available. But it requires something of you. It requires letting go. It requires trust.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow. They toil not, neither do they spin. And yet Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The lilies do not worry about tomorrow. They trust that they will receive what they need. They bloom where they are planted and leave the rest to God.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

You can learn from the lilies, Austin. You can do your part and release the outcome. You can plan without obsessing. You can act without anxiously controlling.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

There is a prayer of surrender. Let us speak it now in the silence of your heart: Lord, I give this to you. I have done what I can. The rest is yours. I trust your timing. I trust your wisdom. I release my need to control.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Feel what happens in your body as you truly surrender. The shoulders drop further. The stomach unclenches. The heart opens. This is what trust feels like.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Trust does not mean passivity. It means doing your part and then releasing. It means holding your plans loosely. It means accepting that God's timing may differ from yours.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

In the Doctrine and Covenants, the Lord promises: Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you. Not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This peace is not dependent on circumstances. It is not dependent on everything going according to plan. It is a peace that passes understanding because it comes from a source beyond your control.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

From now on, when anxiety arises because you cannot control something, you will remember this truth. You will take a breath. You will do what you can. And then you will surrender the rest.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The prayer of surrender will become familiar. Lord, I give this to you. I trust your timing. I release control. These words will bring immediate relief.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Combined with your other tools, you now have a complete system. Peace anchor for instant calm. Body scan for physical release. Thought transformation for mental peace. And now, surrender for spiritual peace.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You are covered at every level. Body, mind, and spirit. Anxiety has fewer and fewer places to hide.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Rest in this garden of peace for a moment longer. Feel the divine presence here with you. You are loved. You are supported. You are not alone.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

It is time to return now. As I count from one to ten, you will become alert, carrying divine peace with you.

One... beginning to return.
Two... feeling loved and supported.
Three... becoming more aware.
Four... refreshed and trusting.
Five... halfway back.
Six... alertness increasing.
Seven... feeling wonderful.
Eight... almost there.
Nine... nearly fully awake.
Ten... eyes open, fully alert. You walk in trust now, Austin. God goes with you.
