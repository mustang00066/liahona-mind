ANXIETY - SESSION 3: Transforming Anxious Thoughts (DEEP VERSION)
Duration: ~38 minutes
Voice: Male, British accent, calm and soothing

[BEGIN SCRIPT]

Welcome back, Austin. Today we work with your thoughts. Anxiety often begins as a thought, a worry, a what-if. By transforming how you think, you transform how you feel.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Find your comfortable position. Take a deep breath in... hold gently... and release, letting tension flow away.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Another breath, deeper... feel your body begin to settle... hold... and release, relaxation spreading.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

One more breath... breathing in calm... hold... and as you exhale, let your eyes close and your mind quiet.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let the golden light of relaxation begin at your head. Scalp softening. Forehead smoothing. Eyes relaxing behind closed lids.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The warmth flows down through your face. Jaw releasing. Neck letting go. Shoulders dropping away from your ears.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Down through your arms, your hands. Through your chest, your stomach. Through your back, your hips, your legs. Your entire body bathed in peaceful warmth.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Now the staircase. Twenty steps down to the deepest peace.

Twenty, nineteen, eighteen, seventeen, sixteen... going deeper.
Fifteen, fourteen, thirteen, twelve, eleven... relaxing more.
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six... almost there.
Five, four, three, two, one... deep hypnosis achieved.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

You are in your garden of peace. The sanctuary within you. From this place of deep calm, we will explore how your thoughts create your feelings.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Anxiety is not caused by events. It is caused by thoughts about events. The same situation can create panic in one person and calm in another. The difference is how they think about it.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your anxious thoughts often follow predictable patterns. You may catastrophize, imagining the worst possible outcome. You may mind-read, assuming you know what others think. You may fortune-tell, predicting disaster.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

These thought patterns are habits, Austin. They feel automatic, but they are learned. And what is learned can be unlearned.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

From now on, when you notice an anxious thought, you will pause. You will recognize it as a thought, not a fact. Thoughts are just mental events. They are not reality.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The scripture teaches that as a man thinketh in his heart, so is he. Your thoughts shape your experience. By directing your thoughts, you direct your life.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let us practice transforming an anxious thought. Think of a worry that has troubled you recently. Notice it in your mind now, but observe it from a distance, like watching a cloud pass.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Ask yourself: Is this thought definitely true? Or is it a possibility I am treating as a certainty? Most anxious thoughts are predictions, not facts.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Ask: What is the evidence for this thought? What is the evidence against it? A balanced view emerges.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Ask: What would I tell a friend who had this worry? Often we are wiser with others than with ourselves.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Now, create a more balanced thought. Not falsely positive, but realistic. A thought that acknowledges uncertainty without predicting catastrophe.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Feel how this balanced thought changes your body. Less tension. Easier breathing. Calmer heart. Thoughts and feelings are connected.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

From now on, you will catch anxious thoughts early. You will recognize them as thoughts, not truths. You will question them, balance them, and let them go.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This becomes easier with practice. Your mind learns to think in new ways. The grooves of worry become shallower. The grooves of peace become deeper.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The Savior said, Take no thought for the morrow, for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Live in the present. Let tomorrow's worries stay in tomorrow.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You have tools now. The peace anchor for instant calm. Body scanning for physical release. And now, thought transformation for mental peace.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

These tools work together. When anxiety arises, you can address it at every level. Body, mind, and spirit. You are equipped.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Rest in this knowledge for a moment. Feel the peace of knowing you have resources. You are not helpless against anxiety. You have real, effective tools.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

It is time to return now. As I count from one to ten, you will become alert, carrying your new understanding with you.

One... beginning to return.
Two... feeling peaceful and wise.
Three... becoming more aware.
Four... refreshed and confident.
Five... halfway back.
Six... alertness increasing.
Seven... feeling wonderful.
Eight... almost there.
Nine... nearly fully awake.
Ten... eyes open, fully alert. Your thoughts are now your allies, Austin. Use them wisely.
