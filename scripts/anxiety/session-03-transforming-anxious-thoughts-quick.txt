Duration: ~28 minutes
Voice: Male, British accent, calm and soothing

[BEGIN SCRIPT]

Welcome back, Austin. Today we work with your thoughts. Anxiety often begins as a thought, a worry. By transforming how you think, you transform how you feel.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Take a deep breath in... hold... and release, letting tension flow away.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Another breath, deeper... hold... and release, body relaxing.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One more breath... eyes closing as you exhale, mind quieting.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let relaxation flow through you quickly. Head to toe. Golden warmth spreading. Shoulders dropping. Jaw releasing. Complete peace.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Descend now. Ten to one. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Deep hypnosis.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Austin, anxiety is not caused by events. It is caused by thoughts about events. The same situation can create panic in one person and calm in another. The difference is thinking.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your anxious thoughts follow predictable patterns. Catastrophizing. Mind-reading. Fortune-telling. These are habits, and habits can change.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

From now on, when you notice an anxious thought, you will pause. You will recognize it as a thought, not a fact. Thoughts are mental events, not reality.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The scripture teaches that as a man thinketh in his heart, so is he. By directing your thoughts, you direct your life.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When anxious thoughts arise, ask yourself: Is this definitely true? Or am I treating a possibility as a certainty?

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Ask: What is the evidence for and against this thought? A balanced view emerges.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Ask: What would I tell a friend with this worry?

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Create a more balanced thought. Not falsely positive, but realistic. Feel how this balanced thought changes your body. Less tension. Easier breathing.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The Savior said, Take no thought for the morrow, for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Live in the present.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You have tools now. Peace anchor. Body scanning. Thought transformation. These work together to defeat anxiety at every level.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One... beginning to return.
Two... feeling peaceful and wise.
Three... becoming alert.
Four... refreshed.
Five... eyes open, fully alert. Your thoughts are now your allies, Austin.
