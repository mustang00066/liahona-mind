=== PRE-TALK / SETTLING (1-2 minutes) ===

Welcome back, Austin. Today we address something powerful: your thoughts. Anxiety begins in the mind. A worry crosses your thoughts... and before you know it, your body has responded.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

But thoughts are not facts. They are mental events that arise and pass. You can learn to observe them, question them, and choose which ones to believe.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Find your comfortable position now. The scripture teaches, "As a man thinketh in his heart, so is he." Today, we learn to think thoughts that bring peace.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== INDUCTION - Rapid Relaxation (5-6 minutes) ===

Take a slow, deep breath in through your nose... hold gently... and release through your mouth, tension flowing away.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Another breath... deeper... and as you exhale, allow your eyes to close naturally.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Imagine a warm golden light at the top of your head. Feel it spread down across your forehead... your eyes relaxing... your jaw loosening.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The light flows through your neck and shoulders. Let your shoulders drop completely. Release the weight.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Down through your arms and hands... through your chest and stomach... any tension simply melting away.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Through your lower back, your hips, your legs... into your feet. Head to toe, bathed in peaceful warmth.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

With each breath, you go deeper. With each word I speak, you relax even more.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== DEEPENING (3-4 minutes) ===

Imagine a staircase leading down to a quiet study. Ten steps to deep peace and wisdom.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Ten. Stepping down. Going deeper.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Nine. More relaxed.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Eight. Body heavy.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Seven. Mind quiet.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Six. Halfway there.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Five. Subconscious opening.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Four. Ready for change.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Three. Almost there.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Two. One more step.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

One. You enter the study. Complete peace.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== THERAPEUTIC CONTENT (8-10 minutes) ===

--- Thoughts Are Not Facts ---

Austin, this understanding will set you free: Thoughts are not facts. They are mental events... words and images passing through your mind. You are not your thoughts. You are the observer.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Anxious thoughts feel urgent. They demand attention. But intensity is not evidence of truth. Anxious thoughts are louder, not more accurate.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

--- Recognizing Patterns ---

Anxiety thinks in predictable patterns. Catastrophizing jumps to the worst outcome. Mind-reading assumes you know what others think. Fortune-telling predicts disaster. All-or-nothing thinking sees only extremes.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Once you see the pattern, you can question it. Recognition is half the battle.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

--- The STOP Technique ---

Use this when anxious thoughts appear. Four simple steps.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

S: Stop. Acknowledge the thought is there. Don't fight it, just stop engaging.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

T: Take a breath. One slow, deep breath creates space.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

O: Observe. Say, "I notice I'm having the thought that..." See it from a distance.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

P: Proceed with awareness. Question the thought. Let it go. Or take helpful action.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let's practice now. Bring to mind a recent worry. Just let it appear.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Stop. Acknowledge it's there.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Take a breath. One slow breath.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Observe. "I notice I'm having the thought that..." See it from outside.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Proceed. Let it float away like a cloud.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Feel the difference. You have introduced space, choice, awareness.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

--- Questioning Thoughts ---

Three questions to challenge anxious thoughts:

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

"What is the evidence for this thought? What is the evidence against it?"

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

"What would I tell a friend who had this worry?"

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

"What's a more balanced way to see this?"

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

--- Direct Suggestions ---

From this day forward, you recognize anxious thoughts as thoughts, not facts. When worry appears, you observe it with curiosity.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You notice the patterns: catastrophizing, mind-reading, fortune-telling. And when you notice them, you question them.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The STOP technique becomes natural. Stop, Take a breath, Observe, Proceed. Creating space between stimulus and response.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your mind becomes calmer. Thoughts visit and leave. You remain at peace.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

--- Strengthening the Anchor ---

Press your thumb and forefinger together now.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Feel this calm, wise state flowing into your fingers. Peace and clarity stored in this simple gesture.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Release. The anchor grows stronger each time.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

--- Future Pacing ---

See yourself tomorrow. An anxious thought arises. You notice it, observe it, and it passes like a cloud.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

A week from now, the STOP technique is natural. You feel more in control of your inner world.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

A month from now, you no longer believe every worried thought. You question, evaluate, and choose.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== POST-HYPNOTIC SUGGESTIONS (1 minute) ===

These skills are becoming permanent. Throughout your days, you'll notice thought patterns and they'll lose their power.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

The Savior taught, "Take no thought for the morrow." You are learning to stay present.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

=== EMERGENCE (2-3 minutes) ===

Time to return, bringing this wisdom with you.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

One. Beginning to return. Peace coming with you.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Two. Aware of your body. Relaxed but alert.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Three. Energy returning. Mind clear.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Four. Almost fully alert. Feeling wonderful.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Five. Eyes open, fully awake, deeply peaceful in your mind.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Welcome back, Austin. You have powerful tools now. The STOP technique. The three questions. Remember: you are not your thoughts. You are the observer.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Go in peace.
