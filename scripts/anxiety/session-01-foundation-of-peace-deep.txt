Duration: ~38 minutes
Voice: Male, British accent, calm and soothing

[BEGIN SCRIPT]

Welcome, Austin. You have come seeking peace, and peace is what you will find. Whatever anxieties have troubled you, know that relief is possible. You are in the right place.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Find a comfortable position and begin to settle. Take a slow, deep breath in through your nose... hold it gently... and release through your mouth, letting tension flow out with the air.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Another breath, even deeper this time... feel your chest and belly expand... hold... and release slowly, feeling your body begin to relax.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

One more breath... breathing in calm, breathing in peace... hold... and as you exhale, let your eyes close and allow your body to surrender to relaxation.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Now, bring your attention to the top of your head. Imagine a warm, golden light beginning to glow there, like gentle sunlight. This light is healing, calming, deeply peaceful.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let this golden light slowly spread across your scalp. Feel the muscles there softening, releasing any held tension. The light brings peace wherever it touches.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The warmth flows down across your forehead. All worry lines smooth away. The muscles around your eyes relax. Your eyelids become pleasantly heavy.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The light moves down through your cheeks, into your jaw. Let your jaw go slack. Your teeth part slightly. This is where so many hold anxiety, and now it releases completely.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Down through your neck, this healing warmth. Softening any stiffness. Into your shoulders. Let your shoulders drop away from your ears. Feel the weight lifting as tension dissolves.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The golden light flows down your arms, warming them, relaxing every muscle. Through your upper arms, elbows, forearms, into your hands. Your hands become heavy, warm, completely at peace.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The light spreads through your chest now. Feel your breathing deepen naturally. Your heart beats calmly, steadily. Peace fills the space where anxiety once lived.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Down into your stomach. This is another place anxiety often dwells. Feel the light dissolving any knots, any butterflies. Your stomach softens, relaxes. Profound peace.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Through your lower back, your hips. Down into your thighs, your knees, your calves. Into your feet and toes. Your entire body is now bathed in this warm, healing light.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

You are safe. You are at peace. You are ready to go deeper.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Imagine yourself at the top of a gentle staircase. This staircase has twenty steps, leading down to a beautiful garden of peace. With each step, you go deeper into relaxation.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Step twenty. Beginning your descent. Relaxation deepening.
Step nineteen. The world above fading.
Step eighteen. Going deeper with each step.
Step seventeen. Your body so heavy, so relaxed.
Step sixteen. Mind quieting. Peace increasing.
Step fifteen. Halfway there. Deeper still.
Step fourteen. Releasing everything.
Step thirteen. Profound relaxation.
Step twelve. Your subconscious opening.
Step eleven. So peaceful.
Step ten. Entering the deepest levels.
Step nine. Every suggestion received powerfully.
Step eight. Going deeper.
Step seven. Profound hypnotic state.
Step six. Almost there.
Step five. So deep now.
Step four. Deeper than ever before.
Step three. The deepest peace.
Step two. One more step.
Step one. You step into the garden.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

You are now in a beautiful garden of peace. This is your sanctuary, Austin. A place of safety and calm that exists within you always. Look around. See the flowers, the gentle light, feel the perfect temperature. This is peace.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

anxiety is not your natural state. Peace is. You were created for peace. Anxiety is a learned response, and what has been learned can be unlearned.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The Savior said, Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you. Not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid. This peace is His gift to you.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Anxiety often comes from worry about the future or regret about the past. But right now, in this present moment, you are safe. You are at peace. There is nothing to fear in this moment.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This is the secret: peace lives in the present. When you are fully present, fully here, anxiety cannot survive. It needs the fuel of past and future to exist.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

From this day forward, you will practice returning to the present moment. When anxiety arises, you will notice it, and then gently bring your attention to now. What do you feel right now? What do you see? What do you hear? This is now, and now is safe.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let us create a peace anchor. This is a physical trigger that will instantly bring calm whenever you use it. Press your thumb and forefinger together gently on your right hand.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

As you hold this gesture, feel the peace of this garden flowing into you. Deep, profound peace. This feeling is now linked to this gesture.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Hold the pressure. Feel the peace intensifying. Your subconscious is recording this connection. Thumb and finger together means peace.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Release now. The anchor is set. Whenever you press thumb to forefinger, peace will return. You have created an instant access point to calm.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

in the coming sessions, you will learn more tools for managing anxiety. You will release physical tension. You will transform anxious thoughts. You will build trust in God. But today, the foundation is laid.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You have discovered the peace that lives within you. You have a sanctuary you can visit anytime. You have an anchor that brings instant calm. These are powerful beginnings.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Rest in this garden for a moment longer. Let the peace soak into every cell of your being. This is your natural state. You are reclaiming what was always yours.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Now, it is time to return, carrying this peace with you. As I count from one to ten, you will gradually become more alert, but the peace will remain.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

One... beginning to return.
Two... feeling the peace coming with you.
Three... becoming more aware.
Four... refreshed and calm.
Five... halfway back.
Six... alertness increasing.
Seven... feeling wonderful.
Eight... almost there.
Nine... nearly fully awake.
Ten... eyes open, fully alert, deeply peaceful. The peace remains, Austin. It is always available to you.
