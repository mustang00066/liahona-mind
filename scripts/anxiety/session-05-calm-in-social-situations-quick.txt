[BEGIN SCRIPT]

Welcome back, Austin. Today we focus on social situations. You can learn to feel calm and confident around others.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Take a deep breath in... hold... and release, feeling safe.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Another breath, deeper... hold... and release, relaxation deepening.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One more breath... eyes closing as you exhale, body softening.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let relaxation flow through you. Head to toe. Golden warmth spreading. Shoulders dropping. Stomach settling. Complete peace.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Descend now. Ten to one. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Deep hypnosis.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

In your garden of peace, you are completely accepted. There is no judgment. You are simply you, and that is enough.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Social anxiety comes from fear of rejection. But your worth does not depend on others' opinions. You are a child of God. Your worth is inherent.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The scripture says, The worth of souls is great in the sight of God. Including yours. Your worth is not up for debate.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Imagine approaching a social situation. In the past, you felt nervous. But now, something different happens.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You take a breath. You press your peace anchor. Instant calm. You remember: I am enough.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You enter with quiet confidence. Not arrogance, but calm assurance. You focus outward, interested in others, not obsessed with how you appear.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When you focus outward, anxiety dissolves. Be curious instead of worried. Interested instead of self-conscious.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

See yourself now. Calm. Present. Interested in others. Body relaxed. Mind clear. This is the new you.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Before any social situation, take a breath and remember your worth. Shift focus from yourself to others. Be curious instead of worried.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Each calm interaction builds confidence. Social ease becomes natural.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One... beginning to return.
Two... feeling confident and worthy.
Three... becoming alert.
Four... refreshed and at ease.
Five... eyes open, fully alert. You are at ease with others now, Austin.
