[BEGIN SCRIPT]

Welcome, Austin. You have come seeking peace, and peace is what you will find. Whatever anxieties have troubled you, relief is possible.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Take a deep breath in... and release, letting tension flow out.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Another breath, deeper... and release, body relaxing.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

One more breath, eyes closing, entering hypnosis now.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let relaxation flow through your body quickly. Head to toe, releasing everything. Golden warmth spreading through you. Shoulders dropping. Jaw releasing. Stomach softening. Complete peace.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Descend now. Ten to one. Going to your inner garden of peace. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You are now in your sanctuary. A beautiful garden of peace within you. This place is always available. It is your natural state.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Austin, anxiety is not your natural state. Peace is. You were created for peace. Anxiety is a learned response, and what has been learned can be unlearned.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The Savior said, Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid. This peace is His gift to you.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Anxiety often comes from worry about the future or regret about the past. But right now, in this present moment, you are safe. Peace lives in the present.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

From this day forward, when anxiety arises, you will return to the present moment. What do you feel right now? What do you see? This is now, and now is safe.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let us create a peace anchor. Press your thumb and forefinger together gently.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Feel the peace of this garden flowing into you. Deep, profound peace. This feeling is now linked to this gesture.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Hold the pressure. The connection is being recorded. Thumb and finger together means peace.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Release. The anchor is set. Whenever you press thumb to forefinger, peace returns instantly.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

In coming sessions, you will learn more tools. But today, the foundation is laid. You have discovered the peace within you. You have a sanctuary and an anchor.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Rest in this peace for a moment. This is your natural state. You are reclaiming what was always yours.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

One... beginning to return.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Two... peace coming with you.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Three... becoming alert.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Four... refreshed.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Five... eyes open, fully alert, deeply peaceful. The peace remains, Austin. It is always available to you.
