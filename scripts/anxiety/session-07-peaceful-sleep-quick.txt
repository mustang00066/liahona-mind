Duration: ~28 minutes
Voice: Male, British accent, calm and soothing

[BEGIN SCRIPT]

Welcome, Austin. Tonight we focus on sleep. You will learn to quiet the racing mind and find peaceful rest.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

You are lying down, ready for sleep. Take a deep breath in... hold... and release, letting the day fall away.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Another breath, deeper... releasing everything from today... hold... and release, sinking into your bed.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One more breath... eyes growing heavy... hold... and release, body surrendering.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let a wave of warmth begin at your head. Melting tension from your scalp. Softening your forehead. Relaxing your eyes.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The warmth flows down. Face relaxing. Jaw unclenching. Neck releasing into your pillow. Shoulders melting. Arms heavy. Chest calm.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Stomach soft. Back releasing. Legs heavy. Feet warm and still. Complete surrender to rest.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Descend now. Ten to one. Ten, nine, eight... becoming drowsy. Seven, six, five... mind quieting. Four, three, two, one... deepest peace.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Here, the worries of the day cannot follow. Night is not for solving problems. Night is for resting.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When thoughts try to race, set them aside gently. Not now. Tomorrow. Your mind quiets.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Imagine a shelf beside your bed. Place any thought that keeps you awake on this shelf. It will be there in the morning. For now, it rests, and so do you.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The Psalmist wrote, He giveth his beloved sleep. Sleep is a gift. Receive it by letting go.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let go of trying to sleep. Let go of tomorrow. Let go of today. Just... let... go.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your body knows how to sleep. Trust this process. Sleep is coming.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Feel yourself drifting. Thoughts becoming dreamlike. You are safe. Sleep is near.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your sleep shall be sweet tonight. Free from anxiety. Full of rest. Tomorrow, you wake refreshed. But now, only rest.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Breathe slowly. Each breath takes you deeper. Deeper into rest.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Sleep now, Austin. You are safe. You are at peace. Sleep well.

[PAUSE 10 SECONDS]

[SOFT FADE TO SILENCE]
