Duration: ~38 minutes
Voice: Male, British accent, calm and soothing

[BEGIN SCRIPT]

Welcome back, Austin. Today we focus on social situations. For many, anxiety peaks around other people. But you can learn to feel calm and confident in any social setting.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Find your comfortable position. Take a deep breath in... hold gently... and release, feeling safe in this moment.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Another breath, deeper... knowing you are accepted... hold... and release, relaxation deepening.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

One more breath... breathing in confidence... hold... and as you exhale, let your eyes close and your body soften.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let the golden light of peace begin at your head. Warming, calming, dissolving any self-consciousness. Scalp softening. Forehead smoothing. Eyes relaxing.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The warmth flows through your face, the face others see. Know that this face is acceptable. It is enough. Jaw releasing. Neck letting go.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Down through your shoulders, arms, chest. Through your stomach where social nervousness often dwells. Feel the light dissolving butterflies, creating calm.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Now the staircase. Twenty steps down to the deepest peace.

Twenty, nineteen, eighteen, seventeen, sixteen... going deeper.
Fifteen, fourteen, thirteen, twelve, eleven... relaxing more.
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six... becoming more confident.
Five, four, three, two, one... deep hypnosis achieved.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

You are in your garden of peace. Here, you are completely accepted. There is no judgment. There is no expectation. You are simply you, and that is enough.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Social anxiety often comes from a core fear: What if they reject me? What if they judge me? What if I am not enough?

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

These fears assume that your worth depends on others' opinions. But this is not true. Your worth is inherent. You are a child of God. No one can take that from you.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The scripture says, The worth of souls is great in the sight of God. Not some souls. All souls. Including yours. Your worth is not up for debate.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When you truly know your worth, others' opinions lose their power. They may approve or disapprove. Either way, you remain yourself. Either way, you are enough.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let us reprogram your response to social situations. Imagine yourself approaching a social gathering. Perhaps a party. A meeting. A casual conversation.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

In the past, you may have felt your heart race. Your palms sweat. Your mind go blank. But watch now as something different happens.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You take a breath. You press your peace anchor. Instant calm flows through you. You remember: I am enough. I have worth that does not depend on this interaction.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You enter the situation with quiet confidence. Not arrogance, but a calm assurance. You are interested in others, not obsessed with how you appear.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

When you focus outward instead of inward, anxiety dissolves. Instead of wondering what others think of you, wonder what you might learn from them. Be curious, not worried.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

If the conversation flows, wonderful. If it feels awkward, that is also fine. You do not need every interaction to be perfect. You only need to be present.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

See yourself in the social situation now. Calm. Present. Interested in others. Your body is relaxed. Your mind is clear. This is the new you in social settings.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The Savior was at ease with all people. Rich and poor. Religious leaders and sinners. He did not seek approval because He knew who He was. You can learn this too.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

From now on, before entering any social situation, you will take a breath and remember your worth. You will shift focus from yourself to others. You will be curious instead of worried.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your peace anchor works especially well in social settings. A quick press, and calm returns. No one will notice. You have invisible support.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Social situations become easier with practice. Each calm interaction builds your confidence. The neural pathways of social ease grow stronger. It becomes natural.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Rest in this knowledge for a moment. Social anxiety is diminishing. Calm confidence is growing. You are becoming someone who enjoys connecting with others.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

It is time to return now. As I count from one to ten, you will become alert, carrying social confidence with you.

One... beginning to return.
Two... feeling confident and worthy.
Three... becoming more aware.
Four... refreshed and at ease.
Five... halfway back.
Six... alertness increasing.
Seven... feeling wonderful.
Eight... almost there.
Nine... nearly fully awake.
Ten... eyes open, fully alert. You are at ease with others now, Austin. Your worth is secure.
