ANXIETY - SESSION 2: Releasing Physical Tension (DEEP VERSION)
Duration: ~38 minutes
Voice: Male, British accent, calm and soothing

[BEGIN SCRIPT]

Welcome back, Austin. Today we focus on your body. Anxiety lives not just in the mind but in the muscles, the breath, the nervous system. By releasing physical tension, you free yourself from anxiety's grip.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Find your comfortable position. Take a deep breath in... hold... and release with a sigh, already beginning to relax.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Another breath, deeper... filling completely... hold... and release, feeling your body soften.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

One more breath... in... hold... and eyes closing as you exhale, entering deep relaxation.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let the golden light of relaxation begin at your head and flow downward. Scalp softening. Forehead smoothing. Eyes relaxing. Jaw releasing.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Neck releasing. Shoulders dropping completely. Arms becoming heavy. Hands warm and relaxed.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Chest opening. Stomach softening. Back releasing. Hips, legs, feet, all letting go completely.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Now the staircase. Twenty steps down to the deepest peace.

Twenty, nineteen, eighteen, seventeen, sixteen... going deeper.
Fifteen, fourteen, thirteen, twelve, eleven... relaxing more.
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six... almost there.
Five, four, three, two, one... deep hypnosis achieved.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

anxiety often manifests in the body before you consciously recognize it. Tight shoulders. Shallow breath. Clenched jaw. Racing heart. Knots in the stomach. These are anxiety's physical signatures.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Today you learn to recognize these signals and release them before anxiety takes full hold. Your body becomes an early warning system and a release valve.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let us do a thorough body scan. I will guide your attention through each area, and you will consciously release any remaining tension.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Bring your awareness to your forehead. Is there any tension there? Any furrowing? Let it go now. Feel the forehead smooth and open.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Move to your eyes. The muscles around your eyes can hold significant tension. Let them soften completely. Your eyelids are heavy and relaxed.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your jaw now. This is a primary tension point for anxiety. Is your jaw clenched at all? Let it drop. Let your teeth part. Let your tongue rest easily in your mouth.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your neck. Check for any stiffness, any holding. Let it all release. Your head is supported; your neck can let go.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your shoulders. Feel if they are raised toward your ears at all. Drop them. Drop them further. Let them be heavy and low.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your chest. Sometimes we hold our breath or breathe shallowly when anxious. Take a deep breath and let your chest open. Breathe from your belly, not just your chest.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Your stomach. Anxiety often knots the stomach. Place your attention there now. Consciously soften. Let the belly be soft and round. Release any clenching.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your lower back. Another common tension point. Let it release into the surface supporting you.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your hips, your thighs, your calves, your feet. Scan through and release any holding anywhere.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your entire body is now deeply relaxed. Remember this feeling. This is what your body can feel like all the time.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The scripture says, Be still, and know that I am God. Stillness in your body creates space for stillness in your mind. Physical peace opens the door to spiritual peace.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

From now on, you will do brief body scans throughout your day. It takes only seconds. Shoulders, jaw, breath. Are they tense? Release them.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This quick scan will become automatic. Several times a day, your awareness will check in with your body. Tension detected will be released immediately, before it builds into anxiety.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let us practice the quick scan now. In your imagination, see yourself in a normal daily situation. You pause. You check shoulders—release. Jaw—release. Breath—deepen. Three seconds, and tension is gone.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

This is your new habit. Quick scan, quick release. Tension never accumulates. Anxiety never builds momentum.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your breathing is particularly powerful. When you breathe deeply from your belly, your nervous system receives a signal of safety. The fight-or-flight response calms. The relaxation response activates.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Practice 4-4-4 breathing. Inhale for four counts. Hold for four counts. Exhale for four counts. This pattern tells your body: all is well.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Let us do it now. Inhale, two, three, four. Hold, two, three, four. Exhale, two, three, four.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Again. Inhale, two, three, four. Hold, two, three, four. Exhale, two, three, four.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Feel how your body responds. Calmer. More at ease. You can do this anywhere, anytime, and no one will know. It is invisible anxiety relief.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your body is now programmed to release tension automatically. Physical anxiety will be caught early and released quickly. You are mastering your physical state.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Combined with your peace anchor from session one, you now have powerful physical tools. Anchor for instant calm. Body scan for ongoing release. 4-4-4 breathing for nervous system reset.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let this programming settle deep into your body and mind. You are becoming a master of your physical response to stress.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

It is time to return now. As I count from one to ten, you will become alert, carrying your new body awareness with you.

One... beginning to return.
Two... feeling your body, relaxed and aware.
Three... becoming more alert.
Four... refreshed.
Five... halfway back.
Six... energy returning.
Seven... feeling wonderful.
Eight... almost there.
Nine... nearly awake.
Ten... eyes open, fully alert. Your body is your ally now, Austin. Let it help you stay calm.
