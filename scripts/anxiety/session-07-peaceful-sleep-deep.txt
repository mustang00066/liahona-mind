Duration: ~38 minutes
Voice: Male, British accent, calm and soothing

[BEGIN SCRIPT]

Welcome, Austin. Tonight we focus on sleep. Anxiety often strikes at bedtime, when the mind has nothing to distract it. You will learn to quiet that racing mind and find peaceful rest.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

You are already lying down, ready for sleep. Take a deep breath in... hold gently... and release, letting the day fall away.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Another breath, deeper... releasing everything from today... hold... and release, sinking into your bed.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

One more breath... breathing in sleepiness... hold... and as you exhale, let your eyes grow heavy and your body surrender.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let the darkness behind your eyes become soft and welcoming. This is the darkness of rest, of renewal. You are safe in this darkness.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let a wave of warmth begin at your head. Melting tension from your scalp. Softening your forehead. Relaxing the tiny muscles around your eyes.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The warmth flows down through your face. Your jaw unclenches. Your tongue rests easily. Your neck releases into your pillow.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your shoulders melt into the mattress. Your arms become heavy. Your hands are warm and still. Complete surrender.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The warmth spreads through your chest. Your breathing is slow and deep. Your heart beats calmly, steadily. Each beat says: rest, rest, rest.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your stomach is soft and relaxed. Your lower back releases. Your hips sink into the bed. Your legs are heavy, so heavy. Your feet are warm and still.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Now, let us descend to the deepest sleep. Twenty steps down, down, down.

Twenty, nineteen, eighteen... becoming drowsy.
Seventeen, sixteen, fifteen... eyelids so heavy.
Fourteen, thirteen, twelve... mind quieting.
Eleven, ten, nine... deeper into peace.
Eight, seven, six... almost asleep.
Five, four, three... so relaxed.
Two, one... the deepest peace.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

You are in a place of perfect rest, Austin. Here, the worries of the day cannot follow. Here, there is only peace and restoration.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The racing mind that kept you awake before was trying to solve problems. But night is not for solving. Night is for resting. The problems will still be there tomorrow, and you will face them better after sleep.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

From now on, when thoughts try to race at bedtime, you will notice them and gently set them aside. You will say: Not now. Tomorrow. And your mind will quiet.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Imagine a shelf beside your bed. Any thought that tries to keep you awake, you simply place on this shelf. It will be there in the morning if you need it. For now, it rests, and so do you.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The shelf holds your thoughts safely. You do not need to carry them through the night. You release them, and they stay on the shelf.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The Psalmist wrote, He giveth his beloved sleep. Sleep is a gift from God. It is not something you must struggle to achieve. It is something you receive by letting go.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let go now. Let go of trying to sleep. Let go of worry about tomorrow. Let go of analysis of today. Just... let... go.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Your body knows how to sleep. It has done it thousands of times. Trust your body. Trust this process. Sleep is coming.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Feel yourself drifting now. The edges of consciousness softening. Thoughts becoming dreamlike. You are safe. You are peaceful. Sleep is near.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

In Proverbs it says, When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid: yea, thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet. Your sleep will be sweet tonight. Free from anxiety. Full of rest.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

As you sleep, your body repairs itself. Your mind processes the day. Your spirit renews. Sleep is productive even as you do nothing. Trust this process.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Tomorrow, you will wake refreshed. Clear-headed. Ready to face the day. But that is tomorrow. Right now, there is only rest.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You may listen to this recording each night until peaceful sleep comes naturally. Your mind will learn to associate bedtime with calm. The pattern will become automatic.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Now, drift deeper into sleep. I will be silent soon, and you will continue descending. There is no need to wake, no need to emerge. Only rest.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Peace surrounds you. Safety holds you. Sleep welcomes you. Let go completely now.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Breathe slowly. Peacefully. Each breath takes you deeper. Deeper into rest. Deeper into renewal.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Sleep now, Austin. You are safe. You are at peace. Sleep well.

[PAUSE 10 SECONDS]
