Duration: ~38 minutes
Voice: Male, British accent, calm and soothing

[BEGIN SCRIPT]

Welcome back, Austin. Today we address one of anxiety's deepest roots: the fear of uncertainty. By learning to embrace the unknown, you free yourself from endless worry.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Find your comfortable position. Take a deep breath in... hold gently... and release, letting go of the need to know.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Another breath, deeper... accepting this moment as it is... hold... and release, relaxation deepening.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

One more breath... breathing in acceptance... hold... and as you exhale, let your eyes close and your mind open.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let the golden light of peace begin at your head. This light dissolves the need for certainty. Scalp softening. Forehead smoothing. The thinking mind quieting.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The warmth flows through your face, your jaw, your neck. Down through your shoulders which carry so much worry. Let them release completely.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Down through your arms, your chest, your stomach. Through your entire body. You are bathed in accepting peace.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Now the staircase. Twenty steps down to the deepest peace.

Twenty, nineteen, eighteen, seventeen, sixteen... going deeper.
Fifteen, fourteen, thirteen, twelve, eleven... letting go further.
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six... releasing the need to know.
Five, four, three, two, one... deep hypnosis achieved.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

You are in your garden of peace. Here, there is no past to regret, no future to fear. There is only this perfect present moment.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Much of your anxiety comes from intolerance of uncertainty. The mind desperately wants to know: What will happen? Will it be okay? When will I know for sure?

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

But life is fundamentally uncertain. No amount of worrying can make the future certain. Worry is not preparation. It is suffering in advance.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The truth is, you have always lived with uncertainty. Every day of your life, you did not know what would happen. And yet, here you are. You have survived every uncertain day so far.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The scripture counsels, Be not afraid, only believe. Faith is the capacity to move forward despite uncertainty. It is not knowing and acting anyway.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Consider this: certainty is often an illusion anyway. Plans change. Expectations shift. The only real certainty is this present moment. And in this moment, you are safe.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let us practice sitting with uncertainty. Think of something in your life that is uncertain. An outcome you await. A question unanswered. Feel the discomfort this uncertainty creates.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Now, instead of fighting this discomfort, breathe into it. Let the uncertainty exist without demanding resolution. Say to yourself: I do not know, and that is okay.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Feel the relief that comes from not needing to know. The struggle was not with uncertainty itself, but with your resistance to it. When you stop fighting, peace returns.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

I do not know, and that is okay. This is one of the most freeing sentences you can say. It releases you from the impossible task of controlling the future.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The Savior taught His disciples not to worry about tomorrow. He knew that worry changes nothing except the quality of today. Be present. Let tomorrow take care of itself.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

From now on, when uncertainty triggers anxiety, you will pause. You will acknowledge: I do not know. Then you will add: And that is okay. You will breathe, and the anxiety will diminish.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Life becomes lighter when you stop demanding certainty. You can plan, prepare, and act. But you release the outcome. You trust that you will handle whatever comes.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Because you will handle it. You always have. Every challenge that arrived, you faced. Every uncertain situation resolved eventually. Your track record for getting through difficult things is one hundred percent.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This is the wisdom of uncertainty tolerance: not that bad things will not happen, but that you will be able to face them when they do. And most of what you worry about never happens anyway.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Rest in this garden of peace for a moment. Feel the freedom of not needing to know. The future will unfold as it will. You will meet it when it arrives. For now, there is only peace.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

It is time to return now. As I count from one to ten, you will become alert, carrying acceptance of uncertainty with you.

One... beginning to return.
Two... feeling free and accepting.
Three... becoming more aware.
Four... refreshed and at peace.
Five... halfway back.
Six... alertness increasing.
Seven... feeling wonderful.
Eight... almost there.
Nine... nearly fully awake.
Ten... eyes open, fully alert. You embrace uncertainty now, Austin. It no longer controls you.
