=== PRE-TALK / SETTLING (2-3 minutes) ===

Welcome back, Austin. Today we address one of anxiety's deepest roots: the fear of uncertainty. This is perhaps the most universal trigger of worry... the unknown future, the unanswered question, the outcome you cannot control.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Anxiety desperately wants certainty. It asks endlessly: What will happen? Will it be okay? When will I know for sure? And when certainty isn't available... which is almost always... anxiety fills the gap with worst-case scenarios.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

But here's a liberating truth: you have always lived with uncertainty. Every single day of your life, you didn't know what would happen next. And yet here you are. You have survived every uncertain day so far. Your track record for handling the unknown is actually perfect.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Today, you'll learn to embrace uncertainty rather than fight it. This doesn't mean giving up planning or preparation. It means releasing the impossible demand that you must know how things will turn out before you can have peace.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Find your comfortable position now. Allow yourself to settle fully. For these next forty minutes, the future can wait. All that exists is this present moment.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

The Savior taught, "Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself." Today, we embrace this wisdom.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== INDUCTION - Eye Fatigue and Diaphragmatic Breathing (10-12 minutes) ===

Before we close your eyes, find a spot above your natural line of sight. Perhaps on the ceiling or high on the wall. Focus your eyes on that spot now.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Notice how this upward gaze begins to tire your eye muscles. The small muscles holding your eyes in position are working... and becoming fatigued. This is completely natural.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

As you maintain this gaze, begin your diaphragmatic breathing. Belly breathing... when you breathe in, your belly expands outward. When you breathe out, your belly button sinks toward your spine.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Breathe in deeply through your nose... let your belly rise... hold for a moment... and release slowly through your mouth.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

This breathing stimulates your vagus nerve... sending a direct signal to your brain: "All is well. We are safe. We can relax." Feel peace spreading through your system.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Take another deep belly breath. Your eyes still focused upward... becoming heavier... more tired. Breathe in... belly expanding... hold... and release.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

One more breath. And as you exhale, allow your eyes to close. Let them fall shut with relief. Feel how good it is to rest them.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Now imagine your neck has become like a bundle of loose rubber bands. All tension dissolving. Your head floating gently... like a helium balloon... supported without effort.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Allow your jaws to sag. Let your mouth open slightly. Your tongue resting loosely. Complete facial relaxation.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Let your shoulders sag completely. All the tension of trying to control the future... let it fall away. Your shoulders dropping as low as they can go.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

Your arms and hands becoming limp, loose, and heavy. So limp, so loose, so heavy with relaxation... like heavy lead weights. So heavy it would take too much effort to lift them.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

Your legs and feet now. Let them go limp, loose, and heavy. Lead weights. Completely letting go.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

The better you feel, the deeper you go. And the deeper you go, the better you feel.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Your eyelids now... so relaxed they've become wonderfully heavy. As though gently stuck together. The harder you might try to open them, the more they want to stay closed.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

It feels so good to just let go. It feels so good to release the need to control. It feels so good to simply be present.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

=== DEEPENING (8-10 minutes) ===

Now let's go deeper. Imagine yourself standing at the edge of a vast, open meadow at dawn. The sky is just beginning to lighten. Mist rises gently from the grass. A path leads into the meadow, toward the unknown.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This meadow represents the future... vast, uncertain, yet beautiful in its possibility. A wooden gate marks the entrance. Twenty steps along the path will take you to a place of deep peace with uncertainty.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Twenty. You step through the gate. The grass is soft and wet with dew. Already you feel yourself going deeper.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Nineteen. Another step into the unknown. The mist parts gently around you.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Eighteen. Deeper now. Your body so heavy and relaxed.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Seventeen. The sky grows lighter. Peace surrounds you.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Sixteen. Going deeper. Releasing the need to know.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Fifteen. Halfway along the path. Birds begin to sing.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Fourteen. Your mind quieting completely.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Thirteen. The mist is thinning. Something appears ahead.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Twelve. Deeper and deeper with each step.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Eleven. Your subconscious mind opening wide.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Ten. A peaceful clearing comes into view.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Nine. Almost there.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Eight. Ready to embrace uncertainty.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Seven. The clearing is beautiful and welcoming.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Six. So deep now. So peaceful.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Five. The sun begins to rise.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Four. Just a few more steps.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Three. Profound peace.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Two. One more step.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

One. You enter the clearing as the sun breaks over the horizon.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

This clearing is your sanctuary of the present moment. Here, there is no past to regret, no future to fear. Only this eternal now. The sunrise reminds you that each day is new, unknown, and full of possibility.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

Find a comfortable spot in this clearing. Perhaps a flat stone warmed by the first rays of sun. Sit down and feel the warmth spreading through you as you go even deeper into peace.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== THERAPEUTIC CONTENT (15-18 minutes) ===

You remain in complete control. Your deeper mind will accept only the suggestions that align with your values and serve your growth. Everything else simply fades away.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

--- The Anxiety of Uncertainty ---

Austin, much of your anxiety comes from intolerance of uncertainty. The mind desperately wants to know what will happen, wants guarantees, wants to see the path clearly before taking a step.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

This is understandable. Uncertainty feels threatening. When we don't know what's coming, we feel vulnerable. So the mind tries to create certainty through worry... running scenarios, predicting problems, rehearsing disasters.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

But here's what worry doesn't tell you: no amount of worrying can make the future certain. Worry is not preparation. It is suffering in advance for things that usually never happen.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Studies show that the vast majority of what we worry about never comes to pass. And for the things that do happen, our worry didn't help us handle them better... it just made us suffer longer.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- The Illusion of Certainty ---

Consider this: certainty is often an illusion anyway. How many times have you been "certain" about something only to have it turn out differently? Plans change. Expectations shift. People surprise you. Life takes unexpected turns.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

The only real certainty is this present moment. Right now, you are here. You are safe. You are breathing. Everything else... the past is memory, the future is imagination. Only now is real.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

When you anchor yourself in the present moment, uncertainty loses much of its power. You're not trying to control the entire future anymore... you're just handling this moment. And this moment is manageable.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

--- Learning to Sit with Uncertainty ---

Let's practice something now. Bring to mind something in your life that is currently uncertain. An outcome you're waiting on. A question that hasn't been answered. A situation you can't fully control.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Notice the discomfort this uncertainty creates. Perhaps a tightness in your chest. A knot in your stomach. A restlessness in your mind that wants to figure it out, solve it, know the answer.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Now, instead of fighting this discomfort, breathe into it. Let the uncertainty exist without demanding resolution. Let the not-knowing be present without trying to fix it.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Say these words in your mind: "I do not know how this will turn out. And that is okay."

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

Feel what happens when you stop fighting. The struggle was never with the uncertainty itself... it was with your resistance to it. When you stop resisting, something shifts. Peace becomes possible even without answers.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- I Do Not Know, And That Is Okay ---

"I do not know, and that is okay." This may be one of the most freeing sentences you can speak. It releases you from the impossible task of controlling the future. It accepts reality as it is.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

This is not resignation or giving up. You can still plan, prepare, and take wise action. But you release your attachment to the outcome. You do your part and trust that you'll handle whatever comes.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Because you will handle it. You always have. Think back on your life... every challenge that arrived, you faced. Every crisis that emerged, you navigated. Every uncertain situation eventually resolved, one way or another. You are here, proof of your own resilience.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

--- Faith and Uncertainty ---

The scripture counsels, "Be not afraid, only believe." Faith is precisely the capacity to move forward despite uncertainty. It is not knowing and acting anyway.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Faith doesn't eliminate uncertainty... it provides a foundation that can hold you even in the unknown. You may not know what will happen, but you know you are not alone. You know there is a God who sees the whole picture. You know that even the difficult experiences can work for your good.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

"For I know the plans I have for you, declares the Lord, plans for welfare and not for evil, to give you a future and a hope." You don't need to know all the details of the plan. You only need to trust the One who does.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Direct Suggestions ---

Austin, receive these suggestions now into the deepest part of your being.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

From this day forward, you develop increasing tolerance for uncertainty. When you don't know how something will turn out, you can sit with that not-knowing peacefully. "I do not know, and that is okay" becomes a natural response.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

You recognize that worry is not preparation. It is suffering in advance. When you catch yourself worrying about uncertain futures, you gently return to the present moment. You ask: "Am I okay right now?" The answer is almost always yes.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

You make friends with the unknown. Instead of seeing uncertainty as threatening, you begin to see it as possibility. The unknown future holds not just potential problems, but potential gifts, surprises, and blessings you cannot yet imagine.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

You trust in your own resilience. Whatever comes, you will face it. You have a perfect track record for getting through difficult things. This trust allows you to move forward even without guarantees.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

You anchor in the present moment. This is the only moment that is real. Here, now, you are safe. Here, now, you can handle what's in front of you. The future will become the present when it arrives, and you will meet it then.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

--- Strengthening the Anchor ---

Press your thumb and forefinger together now.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Feel this peaceful acceptance of uncertainty flowing into your fingers. The freedom of not needing to know... the trust in your own resilience... the peace of the present moment... all stored in this gesture.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Your anchor now carries physical calm, mental clarity, spiritual trust, and peace with uncertainty. A complete resource at your fingertips.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

Release. The anchor is reinforced.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

--- Future Pacing ---

See yourself tomorrow. An uncertain situation triggers worry. But instead of spiraling, you pause. You say, "I do not know, and that is okay." You take a breath, return to the present, and the worry dissolves.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

A week from now, you notice something different. The constant need to know the future has loosened. You're more comfortable with open questions, unresolved situations, unknown outcomes. Life feels lighter.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

A month from now, your relationship with uncertainty has fundamentally transformed. You've discovered that the unknown isn't the enemy... resistance to it was. Now you move through life with a quiet confidence, trusting yourself and trusting God, even when you can't see the path ahead.

[PAUSE 6 SECONDS]

=== POST-HYPNOTIC SUGGESTIONS (2-3 minutes) ===

The peace with uncertainty you've found today integrates fully into your being. Each day, this tolerance deepens. Each uncertain moment becomes an opportunity to practice presence.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

"I do not know, and that is okay" becomes a natural response to the unknown. These words bring immediate relief whenever uncertainty triggers worry.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Remember the Savior's invitation to not worry about tomorrow. The morrow will take care of itself. Your job is to be present to today, trusting that tomorrow's grace will arrive when tomorrow arrives.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

You are safe in the present moment. You will handle what comes. And the unknown future holds gifts you cannot yet see.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

=== EMERGENCE (3-5 minutes) ===

It's time now to return to full waking consciousness. But the peace with uncertainty stays with you. The acceptance you've found is now part of who you are.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

As I count from one to ten, you'll become gradually more alert, more awake, more refreshed... comfortable with the unknown.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One. Beginning to return. The clearing fading gently.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Two. Becoming aware of your body... so relaxed... so at peace.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Three. Walking back through the meadow... carrying acceptance with you.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Four. Energy beginning to return. Mind at peace.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Five. Halfway back. Freedom from needing to know.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Six. More alert now. Fingers and toes may begin to move.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Seven. Feeling wonderful. Feeling free. Feeling at peace.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Eight. Almost there. Taking a deep, refreshing breath.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Nine. Ready to open your eyes, ready to embrace the unknown.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Ten. Eyes open, fully awake, completely alert, and at peace with uncertainty.

[PAUSE 5 SECONDS]

Welcome back, Austin. Take a moment to feel this new freedom... this release from the need to know.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Remember: You do not need to know how things will turn out. You only need to trust yourself, trust God, and be present to this moment. The rest will unfold as it will.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Go in peace. Walk forward into the unknown with confidence.
