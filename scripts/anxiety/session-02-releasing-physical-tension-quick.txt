Duration: ~28 minutes
Voice: Male, British accent, calm and soothing

[BEGIN SCRIPT]

Welcome back, Austin. Today we focus on your body. Anxiety lives not just in the mind but in the muscles, the breath, the nervous system.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Take a deep breath in... hold... and release with a sigh, beginning to relax.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Another breath, deeper... hold... and release, body softening.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One more breath... eyes closing as you exhale, entering relaxation.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let relaxation flow quickly through you. Head to toe. Scalp softening. Face relaxing. Jaw releasing. Shoulders dropping. Arms heavy. Chest open. Stomach soft. Legs relaxed.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Descend now. Ten to one. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Deep hypnosis.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Austin, anxiety manifests in the body before you consciously recognize it. Tight shoulders. Shallow breath. Clenched jaw. These are anxiety's physical signatures.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Today you learn to recognize these signals and release them before anxiety takes hold. Your body becomes an early warning system and a release valve.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Let us do a body scan. Forehead first. Is there tension? Release it now.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Eyes. Let them soften completely.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Jaw. Let it drop. Teeth parting. This is a primary tension point.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Neck and shoulders. Drop your shoulders. Further. Let them be heavy and low.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Chest. Take a deep breath. Breathe from your belly, not just your chest.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Stomach. Anxiety knots the stomach. Consciously soften. Let the belly be soft.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Lower back, hips, legs, feet. Release any holding anywhere.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Your entire body is now deeply relaxed. Remember this feeling. This is what your body can feel like all the time.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

The scripture says, Be still, and know that I am God. Stillness in your body creates space for stillness in your mind.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

From now on, you will do brief body scans throughout your day. It takes only seconds. Shoulders, jaw, breath. Are they tense? Release them.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

This quick scan will become automatic. Tension detected will be released immediately, before it builds into anxiety.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your breathing is particularly powerful. Practice 4-4-4 breathing. Inhale for four counts. Hold for four counts. Exhale for four counts.

[PAUSE 3 SECONDS]

Let us do it now. Inhale, two, three, four. Hold, two, three, four. Exhale, two, three, four.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Again. Inhale, two, three, four. Hold, two, three, four. Exhale, two, three, four.

[PAUSE 2 SECONDS]

Feel how your body responds. Calmer. More at ease. You can do this anywhere, anytime.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

Your body is now programmed to release tension automatically. Combined with your peace anchor, you have powerful physical tools.

[PAUSE 4 SECONDS]

One... beginning to return.
Two... feeling relaxed and aware.
Three... becoming alert.
Four... refreshed.
Five... eyes open, fully alert. Your body is your ally now, Austin.
