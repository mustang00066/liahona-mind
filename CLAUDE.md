# Project: Liahona Mind

## Auto-Save Rule
Every 10 minutes or after any significant change, run:
git add -A && git commit -m 'Auto-save: [brief description of work done]'

## Project Notes
- Audio files in /audio/ and /public/audio/
- Scripts in /scripts/
- ElevenLabs voices: Adam Stone (male), Serene Presence (female)
- Personal app for Austin - hardcode "Austin" (not [NAME] placeholder)

## Script Structure & Targets
- **Deep sessions**: ~38-42 minutes, ~5,000 words
- **Quick sessions**: ~18-22 minutes, ~2,400 words
- **Austin mentions**: 4-6 in deep, 2-3 in quick

## Required Script Sections
1. Pre-talk/Settling (Deep: 2-3 min, Quick: 1-2 min)
2. Induction - Eye Fatigue + Diaphragmatic Breathing (Deep: 10-12 min, Quick: 5-6 min)
3. Deepening - 20-step staircase for deep, 10-step for quick (Deep: 8-10 min, Quick: 3-4 min)
4. Therapeutic Content (Deep: 15-18 min, Quick: 8-10 min)
5. Post-Hypnotic Suggestions (Deep: 2-3 min, Quick: 1 min)
6. Emergence (Deep: 3-5 min, Quick: 2-3 min)

## Key Techniques
- Eye fatigue induction (James Braid method - upward gaze until eyes tire)
- Diaphragmatic/belly breathing with vagus nerve activation
- Progressive relaxation: "limp, loose, and heavy" / "like lead weights"
- Reciprocal deepening: "the better you feel, the deeper you go"
- Eye catalepsy: "eyelids stuck together"
- NLP anchoring (thumb + finger combinations)
- Progressive anchor building across sessions
- Future pacing (tomorrow, week, month visualizations)

## Anchor Assignments by Series
- **Self-Confidence**: thumb + ring finger
- **Phone Addiction**: thumb + pinky finger
- **Anxiety**: (check existing scripts for anchor)
- Other series: assign unique finger combinations

## Content Guidelines
- NO parent blaming or church/leader blaming
- Subtle LDS/scriptural content woven in naturally
- Evidence-based hypnotherapy techniques
- Address underlying needs, not just symptoms
